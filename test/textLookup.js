1: "Sir, one of the main recommendations of the Press Commission has been the establishment of a Press Council consisting predominantly of representatives of the industry, which should undertake responsibility for the regulation of the press in general.",
2: "I should like now to make a few observations on the Budget. This Budget marks a turning point in the history of our country. It is no use attempting as some of my friends have done either to deprecate the budget very strongly or to suggest that we are not witnessing a new revolution in our methods of fiscal training and technique. I want it to be quite clearly pointed out to my friends that we are now facing the lean years of Indian finance. Hitherto we had revenue surpluses which were a form of public saving and which were meant to be utilised for capital development. Hereafter this form of revenue surplus would not be available. We have therefore to find out ways and means of implementing our great programme of national reconstruction at minimum cost. My point is that the deficit on revenue account would be of the order of about Rs. 19 to 20 crores. Here let me point out that I do not agree with those of my friends in the Finance Department who have attempted to suggest that Rs. 9 or 18 crores which are obtained from Pakistan should be put to the revenue side of the budget; they are to be put on the capital side. But that does not seriously alter the trend of my argument. What I am suggesting is that we would have to be prepared for a deficit of a much higher order even on the revenue side. That itself should make us realise that there are very many problems which we have to face and that we have to undertake ways and means of increasing the resources of our country so that it might be possible for us to have a greater amount of surplus or a greater amount of public saving for the purpose of financing capital development. The Finance Minister in the course of his speech Mr. Deputy Minister pointed out that the deficits during the past two years were of the order of Rs. 83 crores. I venture humbly to disagree with him because I feel that when we are talking of deficits we must take into account the overall deficit incurred by the Central Government and that would be of the order of Rs. 200 crores. During the years of relatively light expenditure we had a shortfall of about Rs. 200 crores. Undoubtedly now when we are going to have a very great amount of expenditure we might have a greater amount of deficit and we would have to find out ways and means of trying to meet our capital expenditure. Some Members have pointed out that deficit financing is good; others have pointed out that it is poison. One hon’ble Member who preceded me pointed out that it could be taken like a tonic. Now I am not willing to enter into the merits of deficit financing or demerits of deficit financing in an academic spirit. The time has now come when we should face realities. I do suggest that we have to indulge in deficit financing because without indulging in deficit financing it would not be possible for us to indulge in capital expenditure on such a large scale. But when we are talking of the scope of deficit financing we would like to place before the House and the Finance Minister the two great limitations which face us. The first limitation that faces us is that concerning the internal price level. The hon’ble the Finance Minister referred to the cost of living. He said that he was going to keep a watch over the cost of living so that it may not shoot up within a short period and make a mess of the plans of capital development. But there is another limitation which has also to be borne in mind a limitation which has not received as much notice as it should have done in all the discussions that have taken place on deficit financing. That limitation is the external limitation or the limitation which arises on account of our balance of payments position. I think this is as important Mr. Deputy Speaker as the internal price level and I should like to elaborate that particular point a bit more because I feel that a time will shortly arrive when we might have either to reconsider our policy or might even have to leave the sterling club of which we are a member. The second serious limitation is as serious as the first. What would be the consequences of deficit financing on our balance of payments? The Finance Minister in his budget speech points out that so far as the balance of payments position is concerned they have now whether it is by accident or design a favourable balance and they have contributed about Rs. 63 crores to the dollar pool during the past six months. But the moment we indulge in deficit financing we have to be prepared for worsening of our balance of payments.",
3: "I am thankful to you for having given me this opportunity long last to say a few words on the Budget. Already much has been said and I think the Finance Minister has come in for his share of congratulations as well as criticisms. So there is not very much to say but I should like to say a few words. The increased development expenditure and the absence of any new taxation has earned for the Budget a good response even from the businessmen. I specially welcome the relief given to the middle classes by raising the exemption limit of income tax in respect of personal income. No doubt this is some relief to the middle classes. But I would request the Finance Minister if he could to raise this exemption limit from Rs. 4000 to Rs. 6000 as that would give substantial relief to the middle classes. I am indeed glad that the Taxation Enquiry Commission has been appointed with Dr. John Mathai as the Chairman and I am sure that many of the vexed problems may be solved through this Commission. At the same time I would request the Finance Minister to put off the Estate Duty Bill for the present since this Enquiry Commission has been appointed and they may go into this question. For I feel that it is not an opportune moment to put on more taxes on the people. Already as Mr. Gadgil has pointed out there are so many taxes on the people. The people are over-burdened by taxes and they are just trying to recover their stability. So in regard to Estate Duty I would ask him to consider about it. My reason for asking it to be postponed is as I have said that the people are still facing economic distress. And then our Government is not able to offer the amenities which other countries have where the Estate Duty exists such as free compulsory education for children free medical aid homes for the poor and the destitute old age pension etc. So my humble suggestion is that this point may be considered by the Taxation Enquiry Commission. I agree that there is a brighter side of the picture and that instead of continually harping on our poverty we should also see the bright side. We are making encouraging progress towards laying the foundation of a welfare state. With the co-operation of all and the implementation of the Five Year Plan I am sure Sir that we should be able to lay the foundations and fulfil the dreams of India. It is indeed encouraging to know from the Finance Minister that there is a tendency of lowering food prices all over the world and in that case the prices in our country too would be lowered. Regarding Defence for obvious security reasons I do not agree with my friends who say that the expenditure should be curtailed. It is not advisable to take any undue risks and slacken the defence arrangements. Indeed defence is one of our valuable assets although strange to say there seems to be adverse opinion in some quarters. I agree with what General Cariappa once said that God and Army are remembered only when there is trouble. The Army consists of the most disciplined and loyal set of young men. It would not be proper to effect economy in the pay of these brave officers as it would not be an incentive for the right type of young men to join the Army and it would become ineffective and inefficient. I believe already officers who were drawing Rs. 1400 as their pay are now getting only Rs. 700 and about Rs. 100 as allowance. That is they are getting about half of what they were getting before. It is very hard for those officers on field duty to establish separate establishments for their families and for their children and I would specially appeal to the Finance Minister to see that the family allowances may be restored to those officers who are on field duty. Economy in Army could be effected in other ways. There is scope for more efficient operation of defence industries which process seems slow and by purchase policy of utilising goods and stores indigenously manufactured. Preferences should be given to country-made war materials such as could be produced here and they would be cheaper than foreign-made goods. I may also suggest that the Armed Forces who are not on field service or under any operational commitments could be utilised for giving military training to the youths in schools and colleges which would teach discipline and loyalty. The University authorities should make military training as part of their compulsory education just as they have adopted social domestic and political sciences. The National Cadet Corps is already incalculating military training in some Universities such as Bombay and Calcutta. But if military training is made compulsory for our university students it will go a long way.",
4: "Sir the Essential Commodities Act was passed five years ago and when the Minister yesterday came with an amending Bill we expected that he would give us a brief report on the working of this measure for the last few years. But unfortunately we are kept in the dark in regard to the exact working of the Act and the nature of the difficulties the Minister is facing. Sir as far as I know many of the provisions of this enactment have been observed more in violation by his agents at the State level. The Food Minister may be very earnest may be very able and may be very anxious to see that the various provisions of the Act are implemented in the most effective manner at the State level but unfortunately his agents at the State level are not equally enthusiastic or equally anxious to observe the provisions of this enactment. The most important objectives of this enactment are to control the supply and distribution of commodities and to maintain a stable price level. In regard to both these aspects I am afraid that the Government has failed to realise the objectives in view. Some time past when there was scarcity of foodgrains attempts were made to make procurement from certain wholesale merchants and from rice mills. In my own State I know of many instances of such procurement where after making known that certain things had to be done and certain steps had to be taken by the merchant community nothing was done later on by the Government when they found that these very orders of the Government were violated. As a result of the violations there was a consequent rise in the prices of foodgrains. In respect of other commodities like iron and steel paper etc. we see a lot of speculative activities but the provisions of the Act have not been brought to bear on them. Perhaps no case of prosecution was launched against those people who contravened the various provisions of the Act. We are interested to know in how many cases the Government have taken steps to prosecute individuals who have violated the various sections of the Act. The Minister said that the powers under the Act were not adequate. We sympathise with the Food Minister but I want to know what action has been taken in this regard by the various State Governments. In regard to the amending provision I want to know from the Minister what would be his difficulty even if minor offences are taken to courts of law. For instance the Motor Vehicles Act deals with various offences both major and minor and various minor offences under the Act are taken to courts and people are prosecuted. What is the difficulty in taking these cases of a minor nature to courts of law? There the people will have some safety that they will get a hearing and if the offences are really offences then they would be prosecuted. Otherwise they will be acquitted. Here the Minister says that there should be a security deposit. If there is a violation of a particular provision of the enactment then the executive authority will have the power either to confiscate a part of the amount or the whole of the amount. We are clothing the executive authority with more powers. I do not grudge giving powers to the executive authority provided they are used properly and effectively and in a most fair manner. But unfortunately there have been discriminations apart from the ineffectiveness of the various provisions. Wherever these provisions were used there had been discriminatory use of these provisions against a few or in favour of a few. Normally when officers are clothed with more powers there is a large scope for corruption. I feel that it would be desirable to avoid such malpractices and it would be desirable I think that even for minor offences the parties should have a chance to defend their actions. I do not think that this problem of dealing with minor offences will become complex or complicated in any way if we take them to courts of law. I want a reply from the Minister in what way he is suffering from a handicap in dealing with minor offences or offences of a technical nature. The hon’ble Member made the point that even if this thing was acceptable to the House he did not know what amount would be demanded as security. So the Minister should tell us what amount is normally expected from a licensee in all cases and what the offences are which are of a technical or minor nature which he has in view. We are not told which are major offences and which are minor offences. Clarifications on these points are necessary. I wish that the Act which came into effect long ago was implemented properly. I know that the Minister here is very earnest in implementing it but his colleagues at the State level and at the Central level are disappointing him.",
5: "The Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948 was good so far as it went. But unfortunately the spirit of it could not be understood or appreciated by the common man in this country. So a new orientation of this policy was given. And the hon’ble Prime Minister after his return from China publicly declared that the future policy of the country or rather the future pattern of society will be the socialist pattern. That was further emphasised by the resolution passed at the Avadi session of the congress and later reiterated by Shri Dhebar President of the Indian National Congress. I am very glad to say that the spirit of it has been caught by the nation today. If I may say so the nation has taken up the challenge for securing the socialist pattern of society. It behoves all sections both inside this House as well as outside without having mutual recriminations to try and propagate in a sincere manner and establish the socialist pattern of society indicated by the statements of the great leaders of our country. It may be relevant and pertinent if I refer to a few sentences from the memorandum presented on the 4th June 1939 by our Prime Minister who was the Chairman of the All India Planning Committee which came into existence when there was provincial autonomy in the provinces. On pages 39 and 40 of that report he stated: It is clear that the drawing up of a comprehensive national plan becomes clearly an academic exercise with no relation to reality unless the planning authority or those to whom it is responsible are in a position to give effect to the plan. If this authority is powerless or circumscribed or restricted and has limited activities it cannot plan. An essential pre-requisite for planning is thus complete freedom and independence for the country and removal of all outside control. This implies that the country possesses in itself full sovereign authority to take any measures adopt any policies and form any relations with other countries as may seem best to its governing authority in the interests of the country and its people. National independence is thus an indispensable preliminary for taking all the steps that might be found necessary for carrying out the five year plan in all its various aspects throughout the whole country. At the present moment it is clear that not only have we in India no national independence but we are hedged in and obstructed by numerous restrictions limitations safeguard and reservations which block the path to planning and progress. Our plan for national development must therefore be drawn up for a free and independent India. Thanks to the sacrifices made by millions of our countrymen and country-women under the leadership of the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi we have today secured complete sovereign political independence at a time when the nations of the world were engaged in the bitterest struggle using all the weapons of destruction. If therefore we have secured political independence during the period of a quarter of a century it should not be difficult especially when we are today masters in our own country to secure a socialist pattern of society as has already been indicated. But it requires the assistance the propaganda the active work of all those who are interested in this. I am sure so long as my hon’ble friends the Minister the Deputy Minister and the other Minister who represent the Commerce and Industry Ministry can give us an assurance that the capitalist pattern would be avoided some of us who believe in a cent per cent socialist democracy give an undertaking that certainly totalitarian policy will not be introduced in this country because we have believed all along during the fight that we have given to the British Government when we secured political independence that we shall try to maintain democracy undiluted and a socialist democracy at that. I am absolutely certain that in this country of ours liberty of thought liberty of speech and liberty of action will be guaranteed to every citizen to express his views in the manner he pleases. I therefore assure my hon’ble friend that so long as we do not in the garb of a socialist pattern support a capitalist system India will stand hundred per cent for a socialist democracy. Now luckily for us the Fundamental Rights of the Constitution have declared that a citizen would be assured of many of the social amenities which will give reasonable comfort from the womb to the grave. But mere enunciation as I have said many times will not satisfy the common man unless the saying is put into effect. I am absolutely certain therefore that so long as there is a determination on the part of our countrymen we will be in a position to secure a socialist pattern of society. It is not even possible to draw up a plan on any other basis.",
6: "There has been some reference to the improvement in our economic situation also. We find that we have made good progress in production. We were faced equally with a difficult situation so far as cloth was concerned. There was a deficit of food and there was also shortage of cloth. I do remember the scenes that we had to witness in several cities where people had to stand in queues for hours together for two yards of very ordinary cloth but now the situation is quite changed. We have produced much cloth and we are in a position to export cloth. During the British period we were required to import cloth but now we are in a position to export cloth. After partition we were faced with the question of raw material namely cotton. We had cotton mills but cotton remained in Pakistan. Even that problem has been solved. We had placed before us a target for more production of cotton and not only has that target been achieved but it has been achieved in shorter period to the satisfaction of all people in the country. From this survey Sir you will find that everybody should be convinced that we are making good progress in the realisation of the objectives of the Five Year plan. Then there is a reference that in several essential commodities we have got increased production. This cannot be denied. In spite of this increased production I must admit we have not been able to solve the question of unemployment but efforts are being made to ease the situation so far as this question is concerned. The main thing to which I would like to refer is that the President was pleased to say and say very plainly that so far as cottage industries were concerned we have not been able to make good progress. As a matter of fact very little progress has been made. If in this country we have to solve the question of unemployment we must take and take very seriously to the development of cottage industries. That alone will solve this problem of unemployment. We want to increase production but we want to take to such means for increasing our production as would be man-absorbing and not man-saving as have been resorted to by the western countries. That alone will solve our problem to a great extent. If we organise our cottage industries if we take to the spirit of Swadeshi I have no doubt we will solve the problem of unemployment to a great extent. Then Sir a reference has been made to certain additional projects which have been included in the Five Year Plan. There was a great demand from Maharashtra to include this project in the Five Year Plan. A couple of years ago there was a conference presided over by my colleague from the district the present Revenue Minister of Maharashtra. He had presided over it and there was a unanimous demand supported by practically the entire people from Maharashtra that this project should be included in the Five Year Plan. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Government of India and the Government of Maharashtra for having seen to it that this project in Maharashtra is included in the Five Year Plan. The President’s Address makes reference to the improvement of our transport and communications. Our increased production leads to the question of better transport facilities. The agricultural production is on the increase but Sir if there is no betterment of our transport facilities this increased production in agriculture will not benefit the agriculturist. In my part of the country even now this situation prevails. The production there is on the increase but the agriculturists are suffering on account of inadequate facilities of railway transport. I was glad to find from the President’s Address that the Railways are thinking of opening even new lines very soon. It has also been said that so far as locomotives and rolling stock are concerned the manufacture of these is going on very satisfactorily and we have made good progress in this respect during the last few years. Any nation can be proud of this achievement. Then there is a reference to the housing conditions. We can very well remember the scenes that we were required to witness immediately after partition. Thousands and tens of thousands of our brethren came to this country from Pakistan. It was a very serious question as to how to house them but the day has come when the question has practically been solved or it can at least be said that we are near the solution of the question. Seventy two crores of rupees have been spent during the last few years in constructing houses for the refugees and in this very city we are witnessing an exhibition where we can see the models of cheap and decent houses. If these cheap houses are constructed for the refugees it will provide shelter for them at a low cost.",
7: "Now I would like to say that with this measure we are now adopting to my mind it will not be possible to have this system or any other system functioning effectively. The number of clauses that we have included are so restrictive and rigid that it will not be possible for any system to function in this country. If at all it is able to function it will be able to function with a lot of difficulties. It will be said afterwards that the industrial sector particularly the private sector has not been able to deliver the goods. I would like to warn the Government that if anything happens in the future in which industrial production or production in the private sector has not gone up it would be not because of any lack of efforts on the part of the private sector but because of the measure that we are now adopting. I have mentioned several times how this particular Bill is very restrictive and how it will hamper the normal growth of companies in this country. It is a pity that when we are on the threshold of the Second Five Year Plan such a measure should be passed in this House. I would now like to make a few observations about the speeches of some of the hon’ble Members here. Shri Ashoka Mehta justifies the restrictions on managing agents by saying that managing agents are no longer the main source of finance. He also argues that profits have been high and will continue to remain high and therefore he would like to see the managing agents being paid on a sliding scale. He is in the habit of referring to a number of books and making quotations from a number of them published in America or in other countries and particularly by some of the professors. I would also like to mention to him that even when companies are floated it requires a certain amount of confidence amongst the investing public and it is because a particular firm is managing a particular company that this confidence is created in the investing public. Even there as the hon’ble Finance Minister has said there is a sort of overall tight control. New banks and insurance companies are not floated nowadays. What you have are the few banks which are existing and the few insurance companies that are existing. The other point is that the credit-worthiness of the managing agency firm does count to a certain extent in getting credit from the banks and other financial institutions. Yesterday it was mentioned by my hon’ble friend that the crux of the problem is the question of payment of remuneration to a particular managing agency system. He said that in this Bill a definite encouragement has been given to the alternative type of management namely the managing director or the manager where an individual has been permitted to take 5 per cent while in the case of the managing agency it has been permitted to take about 10 per cent. I would like to point out to him that it is not merely the question of remuneration which will decide the alternative type of management. The remuneration is not a very important thing. Unless and until you allow a certain amount of flexibility for any system to function it will not be possible to evolve any other system to take the place of the managing agency system. In spite of so many shackles you may find that those few business houses which are carrying on now may have to carry on on the present basis you may not find many new people coming in the field. Several times it has been mentioned in this House why the business community has not prescribed for itself a code of conduct. In this connection I would like to point out that a degree or diploma is essential for the profession and in case of violation of the code sanction should be provided by it to prevent a person from practising the profession. Today even Ashoka Mehta and Shri C.C. Shah can set up a grocery shop and become businessmen. Nobody lays down any condition for starting business and nobody can prevent others from continuing it but I would like to point out that with regard to the code of conduct there is a certain amount of ethics and there are certain standards and traditions on which business houses function. If a particular firm has not got proper ways of managing its business you will find that that business house will find it difficult to function and it would be difficult for it to command the confidence of the business community. It would not be possible for it to function as effectively as a firm which has proper ways of managing its business. That is sufficient as a code of conduct. It is not possible to prescribe a certain code of conduct in the manner it has been done for the profession in general.",
8: "In conclusion I would like to say a word in regard to employment with which I have been dealing so far. According to the figures supplied the number of displaced persons from Bangladesh employed through employment exchanges is only 37000. This is very meagre compared with their total number which comes to 32 lakhs according to the official figures. This is with regard to Bangladesh refugees. The number of displaced persons from Pakistan employed through employment exchanges is not very encouraging but still it is 75000. I would urge upon the hon’ble Minister to take this into consideration and see that something is done to find employment for these people. Of course there is some expenditure incurred on general education and vocational training but when we look at the number of persons who have been given vocational training we find that the number already trained and under training is only 17000. This figure also seems to be very small considering the magnitude of the problem before us. Some programmes of general improvement have been undertaken by the Government of West Bengal by way of setting up new industries etc. These programmes should be looked into and put into operation with a view to giving more employment to these displaced persons. Within the limited time at my disposal I shall limit my remarks to refugees from Bangladesh. The first thing which strikes one as one looks at the various brochures and publications that have been given to us is the amount of contradiction one has to battle against. The first contradiction is in regard to the number of persons Government think they have rehabilitated in West Bengal. Granting that it is difficult to make a final assessment of the number of refugees who have come from Bangladesh it is still true to say that at least there should be some sort of parity between what the Union Ministry says and what the West Bengal Rehabilitation Ministry says. Only a few days ago the West Bengal Minister of Rehabilitation said that there are 22 lakhs of refugees who have to be rehabilitated but the Central Government’s figures are 31 lakhs. Unless the Government know the number of people they have to budget for it is rather bewildering to know how they mean to plan in bringing about their rehabilitation. As a matter of fact many other sources believe that the figure is far higher but in any case there should be some parity and some ideas to the extent of the rehabilitation problem which still remains before the people of West Bengal. The other contradiction is this. On the one hand Shrimati Renuka Ray says that in the near future they will be making a successful completion of the work of economic rehabilitation of refugees in that State but only last year Shri A.P. Jain said that as yet the problem of the displaced persons from Bangladesh was a matter which was giving some concern. I really do not understand why in spite of Shri A.P. Jain recognising that the problem is still quite serious Shrimati Renuka Ray should have made such a statement. Yet when we heard the hon’ble Finance Minister we find that there has been a shortfall in rehabilitation budget. I think that if the Fact Finding Committee’s Report had been published the assessment that we have rehabilitated about fifty per cent of the people of Bangladesh who came over as displaced persons would have become quite clear in regard to its incorrectness. As a matter of fact when we went round the camps and colonies in West Bengal we found that as yet not more than fifteen per cent of the people have been rehabilitated in the sense that they are able to eke out their subsistence on the poorest levels. It is not more than fifteen per cent and I think the figures of the Fact Finding Committee are still lower. I think this is something that we have to take very seriously and put our minds to and apply all the resources that we have to find out how we will be able to tackle this problem of rehabilitation. Now coming to the question of relief I feel that until we are able to give really proper rehabilitation we cannot withdraw relief. It is no use arguing whether relief leads to lethargy and moral slackness. Unless our rehabilitation policies are fruitful have we any right to stave the people to death? As a matter of fact Shri A.P. Jain may know that in West Bengal the incidence of Tuberculosis amongst the refugee population is very high. Only a small percentage of them is catered for by the medical relief given by the Directorate of Rehabilitation. If I am to tell you the tragic fate of the refugees in West Bengal I would refer you to a report which appeared in February 1954.",
9: "Sir the Budget has been variously described and criticised as one that increases the burden of the common man one which gives concessions to the rich and encourages foreign investments. I agree Sir that it is all this and much more. But it certainly is not a highway man’s budget. To my mind Sir the Budget is sincere conscientious and at the same time it is a bold effort on the part of the Finance Minister who is charged with heavy responsibility of finding resources for the Third Five Year Plan. This Plan to my mind Sir is not at all ambitious in view of our needs. It may be looked upon as a rather heavy demand but looking to our needs it is not very ambitious. Sir the fact that even the considerations of the coming general elections could not deflect the Finance Minister from the course which seemed to him necessary and proper should earn him the appreciation of every right thinking man. The common man’s interest as I said is nearer to our hearts than perhaps some others can claim or at least it is equally nearer to us and yet there come times in a nation’s history when it becomes necessary for the people to postpone the fruits of their labour and enterprise to secure the future. Here also Sir opinions may differ. According to the Communist Party such a time came during the last Great War when they were exhorting people the common people to contribute their full mite to the war effort. According to us however Sir we are passing through such a time at the present moment and I have no doubt that the common people appreciate this position and will willingly tighten their belts contribute their full mite and will surely return the Congress to power having full confidence in the future and looking to a future where their posterity will be assured of a far better social and economic order. Who Sir does not sympathise with the difficulties of the common man? As a matter of fact most of us come from that class and I am sure the Finance Minister would have liked to do away with some of the levies. None would have been happier if he could have done without these new levies but there are Sir certain very imperative limitations. We are passing through a critical period. Sir it may not be necessary to continue these levies for a long time; rather I am inclined to think that before long it may be possible to give up some of them at least. I have very valid reasons to think so. Our public undertakings are coming to their own and some of our important irrigation and power projects have just been completed. Some others are nearing completion and in due course. I think in the very near future they must yield returns. This will go a long way to lighten the burden of the common man. We might Sir also resort to some other ways. I suggest that we might take to public trading in some specific items of export and import. That would also certainly go a long way and help us. The private corporate sector has been steadily growing and has been developing capacity. It is sure to benefit from all these present concessions and develop greater capacity. This sector must come forward to meet new demands for taxation in the future. I agree that so far as indirect taxation is concerned it has reached the saturation point but the corporate sector growing as it is in strength in vitality and in capacity will not I am sure shirk its responsibility to contribute to the common fund. I wish Sir the committee which had been appointed to go into where the additional national income had gone had entered upon its labours a bit earlier and had made its findings available to us. I do not want to state its findings but I have a feeling that the committee when it concludes its labours will come to the conclusion that a major portion of this additional national income has gone into the pockets of a comparatively small number of men small number of individuals. And it is they who must in future contribute their share to the country’s taxation needs because the profits they have earned are not all due to their own efforts and enterprise only. To a very large measure they are the result of the economic policies of the Government and due to certain other circumstances to which they did not contribute anything. Therefore there is ample justification for the two taxes the capital gains tax and the excess profits tax. I need not go in details into all the reasons that my hon’ble friend has explained earlier so lucidly but I must say that I entirely agree with them all. Having said this I would like to say a few words about allocations which have been made to the various Ministries in the Budget.",
10: "In discussing the Demands for Grants of the Finance Ministry we have got to see to what extent the administration of this particular Ministry has led to the development of our national wealth and the securing of the welfare which our State claims to have in view. Madam we must try to analyse very carefully the working of this particular Ministry because it is not merely a department of the Government so to say but it is the nerve centre of the administration of the country. I would like first to refer to the role of foreign capital because in determining the manner in which the permission of capital issues has been granted by the particular administration we should keep in our mind to what extent the interests of our nation have been served. I fully endorse the statement which the previous speaker has made so far as repatriation of the investments made by foreigners and of profits are concerned. We have dealt with this topic quite a number of times and I do not want to reiterate anything apart from only supporting what the hon’ble Member who just now spoke said. I would now like to deal with the investments of foreigners in India. Madam the Government of our country accepted the proposition that in allowing foreign investment it should come in only in such industry and such form of production wherein our national investors will not come forward and in which technical skill is wanted. There is also one other factor which the industrial policy of our Government of 1948 as adumbrated further in 1949 by the Prime Minister laid down. It specifically said that the control and ownership of such concerns should as far as possible be in the hands of Indian nationals and the technical know-how of our country should be developed. I would like to emphasise the figures that have been put forward for the last few years. From 1947 till the end of 1952 or the early part of 1952 it has been reported that Rs. 19 crores of foreign capital have been allowed to be invested in our country. Of that practically more than Rs. 6 crores have been allowed to be invested in managing agency and trading enterprises in our country. So far as the Government policy is concerned we find that a sum of Rs. 4 crores has been allowed to be invested this year. We do not know how it is to be used up. We have been told that during the period 1948-53 nearly Rs. 35 lakhs have been allowed to be invested in textile machinery and generally in the textile industry. We have seen to what extent cotton and jute have been dominated by the national capital and to what extent they play the role as against the demand for them. We know further what the Government is doing in regard to these industries and how the Indian counterpart in these industries are behaving. Then why this further penetration of foreign capital? Even in regard to the expansion scheme we find that paints soaps electric fans and machine tools are some of the industries where the Government is allowed foreign interest to establish or expand their factories. It will adversely compete with the production of the country when the indigenous producers do not find any market in this sphere. Therefore we have got to see to what extent the capital issue has been regulated by this Government and particularly by the Finance Department so that the national well-being of the country could be guaranteed. Then we have got to look into the fact as to how far the new industries are allowed to function. So far as the oil refineries are concerned some of them have been established and some more are going to be established very soon. In the control of the administration the Indians have no share. There are only preference shareholders and they have now voice in the management. So far as the administrative aspect in this industry is concerned the most important part of it is the technical know-how. They do not guarantee that they will train the Indians. That means they say even after 20 years we will have to face the problem of the know-how in respect of the oil refineries. I do not know why the Government are showing softness to foreigners in this matter. Then we have another investment in collaboration with the Indian Chemical Industries for the manufacture of civil explosives. Here as far as I have gathered only 20 per cent is going to be Indian capital. The majority of the shares will remain with the Indian Chemical Industries. Nobody else has been allowed to make any investment. It would have been better if other companies and private individuals had been given an opportunity to purchase the shares.",
11: "Sir several questions raised regarding the Defence Ministry and the External Affairs and Irrigation Ministries have been clarified by my colleagues from those Ministries. My task therefore has been simplified to that extent. Before I go to the questions financial and economic raised by several hon’ble Members I should like to clarify one or two points which are more administrative than economic or financial. One of them was raised by my hon’ble friend. He raised the question about the recruitment by the Assistant Superintendents’ Departmental Competitive examination and particularly about the examination held in 1960. He said that about Rs. 6 lakhs were spent for the 1960 examination and later it was declared that no vacancies were available. He therefore suggested that a definite procedure should be there and the examination should be held according to the vacancies declared in advance and all persons who have qualified in that examination should be eligible for promotion or for appointment. Sir I do not know whether the hon’ble Member knows how these vacancies are filled. He probably refers to the Section officers’ Grade in the Central Secretariat Service. This is filled 50 per cent by direct recruitment and 25 per cent by departmental competitive examination open to the Assistants i.e. the next lower grade and the rest 25 per cent by promotion of the Assistants on the basis of seniority subject to fitness. The examination therefore that he was referring to was a departmental competitive examination for filling 25 per cent of the vacancies. It takes about one year for the Union Public Service Commission to declare the results of the examination from the time they take up the question of the examination. It is not therefore possible to declare the number of vacancies to be filled in from the very beginning. To declare them just when the results are out is more realistic and that is what is done. Sir if the examination is treated as qualifying examination the number of persons who will thus become eligible for appointment will be quite unrelated to the number of vacancies to be filled in and then the very situation which the hon’ble Member wishes to avoid would arise. It would not then be possible to hold any of the examinations at regular intervals and promotions against this quota would become very fitful. The hon’ble Member also suggested that the rules for recruitment and promotion etc. Should be uniform for all Ministries whether participating in the Central Secretariat Service Scheme or not. It must be and this is so except for the Ministry of External Affairs and the Railways. These have different rules but these rules are very much similar and there is not much difference. But because these persons are recruited for different purposes and by different agencies they are separate. Therefore his purpose in saying that there should be uniformity is almost carried out. The only difference is that the Ministry of Home Affairs does not control the services in these two Ministries. Then Sir questions were raised about backward areas and the backward States and also about the city of Calcutta. If the Budget is properly scrutinised it would be found that assistance is provided for the States particularly the backward States and the Finance Commission which assesses the overall requirements of the States takes this into consideration and makes its recommendations which are carried out every time the Finance Commission’s recommendations are received and they are received periodically according to the Constitution. Sir I would like to give the total amount paid to the States on this account. The main objective of planning is to create conditions in which living standards are raised in a sufficiently reasonable level and all citizens are given full and equal opportunity for growth and service. The plans seek to provide a balanced emphasis on increase in production and employment. The development plans are thus accepted as the means for ensuring equitable development in the field of social services. There is no reason to suppose that the needs of the less fortunate or prosperous States are being neglected. But it would not be proper to expect that all these differences could be wiped out now immediately. It must be seen whether we are going towards that very end or not. We are deliberately going towards that end and we hope and trust that in course of time these inequalities would be wiped out if not completely wiped out at any rate they would be lessened. My hon’ble friend complained about inadequate provision included in the plan for meeting the growing requirements of the city of Calcutta where even the basic services like water supply sewage disposal and drainage were not being augmented and that the Central Government was not enthusiastic about solving these difficulties.",
12: "I have no intention of giving a certificate about which my hon’ble friend Dr. Krishnaswami was talking some time ago since anything like a certificate being given by any Member of the business community is likely to be misunderstood. But the fact remains that impartial observers both here and abroad have testified to the soundness and stability of our finances which have successfully withstood severe stresses and strains of the changing economic factors both national and international and for this the fullest possible credit is due to the wise handling of the situation by our present Finance Minister. There have been criticisms on both sides. Some have described the Budget as pro-big business as something which has brought about a boom in the stock exchange and as something which has brought about satisfaction in the business circles. The fact is that if there has been any satisfaction it has been due purely to negative features of the budget and not because any positive relief in any direction has been given to business or industry. It is true that there were certain fears in the minds of the business community that in view of the expanding and growing needs of the Centre the Finance Minister might resort to certain further additional taxation and since those fears were not realised there has been some slight recovery in certain stock exchanges but that does not in the least mean that whatever relief and legitimate relief was due to the business and industrial community has received any adequate response from the Finance Minister. We have got to face the fact that we are at present engaged in the process of development. People who talk about U.K. and U.S.A conveniently forget that these are the most highly industrialised countries in the world and our taxation system so long as we are engaged in expanding and building our economy must be adjusted and linked with the requirements of the expanding economy and should not be compared with the high taxation levels that may be prevalent in U.K. and U.S.A. Friends have talked about unemployment. But whether the raising of the direct taxation levels will in any way mitigate unemployment is a question that should be considered. If the Finance Minister gives substantial relief in direct taxation I think that might lead to an acceleration in the pace of development. So it has to be considered whether it is relief in taxation which will lead to a reduction of unemployment or whether it is raising of taxation to the utmost levels which will dry up the resources and channels of capital formation and thereby not only retard all further development but might also throw the functioning of present industries out of gear. So my submission is that when the Taxation Enquiry Committee has been appointed it is only logical to expect that no substantial changes in the taxation structure will be made until the findings of that Expert Committee are known until we know the incidence of taxation in the various sectors of our economy. Now coming to the question of deficit financing I am afraid that my esteemed friend’s attitude was somewhat different from the line of opinion in the business and industrial community. Not that we advocate deficit financing bringing any artificial rise in prices but the fact is that those who have criticised deficit financing have not suggested any other alternative or made any other constructive suggestion which will bring about necessary development plans. After all the fact has got to be faced that whatever programme we have set out in the National Plan should go on unimpeded by any financial considerations. An assurance has been given by the Finance Minister that so far as financial resources are concerned he will ensure that the Five Year Plan will not in any way be retarded. In this connection I can only say that deficit financing is one thing so far as normal expenses and expenditure are concerned. Certainly nobody would advocate deficit financing which might be very undesirable. But when it is a question of doing something abnormal of investing something in productive channels then certainly some risk has got to be taken and I think the Finance Minister has been fully cautious in taking whatever measures he has so far. We know the measures that the Government took for contracting money supply about the end of 1950 and certain other measures adopted which brought about a slump. Also from time to time the Finance Minister did not hesitate to mop up the surplus which as the records would show has been about Rs. 300 crores during the past four or five years.",
13: "In the course of the debate yesterday on the Home Ministry’s Demands a number of points were raised by hon’ble Members. In particular I am happy that some Members of this House appreciated the efforts that were being made by the State Governments as also by the Centre so far as the various subjects under discussion were concerned especially so far as the law and order situation was concerned it was very good on the part of some Members to have appreciated the efforts made by the State Governments in this regard. There were a number of other points also which were raised and in respect of some of them I should like to enlighten the House so far as the real position is concerned. These points deal very briefly with Tripura the Andamans Delhi and Gujarat and they have also some bearing on the question of the Scheduled Castes the Scheduled Tribes and the Services. These therefore are the various points and I should like to place the correct picture before this House so that the House will know what Government have been doing so far as all these questions are concerned. With your permission I would deal briefly with Tripura first. When the Part C States Act was passed in view of a number of circumstances the geographical position of the State the backward nature of the State the existence of a very large number of tribal people and a number of other circumstances it was considered advisable so far as the administration of this State was concerned that it ought to be directly under the Government of India so that they can spend more for the purpose of developing this backward area. Now the question is often raised why we are not immediately introducing popular government in this tiny state the population of which is half a million. That question cannot be considered singly but will be considered in the context of the Report that we are receiving very shortly in the course of the next three or four months from the States Reorganisation Commission. The whole question will be considered. Their recommendations will be placed before the House and only then Government will take appropriate action. So far as the present regime is concerned it will also be kindly noted that it is not an autocratic rule in the popularly accepted sense of the term. Therefore I am pointing out to this House certain circumstances from which the House will gather that Government have been trying their best to improve the conditions there and to develop it to the extent that is possible. I would make a very brief reference to the expenditure during the last three years. For the year 1950-51 Government spent Rs. 95 lakhs. There is a considerable Scheduled Tribes population as also a Scheduled Castes population. Mostly they have come from Bangladesh. A sum of Rs. 17 lakhs has been set apart for the purpose of improving the condition of the Scheduled Castes as also the Scheduled Tribes. Then very great efforts are being made for the purpose of rehabilitating the refugees most of whom are from the Scheduled Castes and it will be found that as a matter of fact 190000 people have been rehabilitated in this tiny State of Tripura. Out of them 99000 and odd have been rehabilitated in Government colonies and land loans have been given facilities for education have been given and in respect of medical facilities it will be found that the amount has increased by at least five times. Then a point was made that unemployment was rising. So far as the question of unemployment is concerned it is a general question and has only a very short specific point so far as the State is concerned. You will find that in view of the development projects that Government have undertaken the number of persons employed or the service personnel in this tiny State has increased. These persons are actually under employment in respect of the different departments so far as development projects are concerned. Then you will also note that for the purpose of providing good buildings for offices especially for schools and hospitals the Government have a proposal before them which is being implemented according to which Rs. 1 crore are going to be spent for the purpose of construction of various buildings. Then we are also taking care to see that crime is not increasing at all. Very vague statements were made that crime was increasing. In fact so far as the border area is concerned there were only two dacoities and no more. Even all the offenders in respect of these offences have been brought under control.",
14: "Sir Now I would like to say something about tea. This time there is taxation on common tea the tea that we are consuming here so that there can be more earnings through export. But if we examine this tea industry we will find that we are not getting good results either by the efforts of the Tea Board or by the efforts of Government. One-fourth of the production of the whole country is represented by tea but that much of attention is not given by the Government to this industry. They think that it is already getting foreign earning and so it should continue to get it. But efforts should be made not only to develop this industry but also to improve the industry through research and other things. As you know in some parts the foreign companies which are working here are neglecting this industry. They are only after the profits they are not thinking of the development of the industry. There is room for development in many respects but it all depends upon research work and research stations should be set up wherever there is neglect. No doubt the Tea Board is there but the Tea Board is not seeing to these things. That is our complaint. In the Tea Board people are there who are not at all eager to see how this industry could be developed how we could earn more profits how the quality could be improved and how the quantity could be increased. We are not seeing to that. I come from a part where the tea industry plays an important part in the economy of that area. But I find that it is being neglected from year to year and no attention is given to it. I find that there is this drought menace in the tea plantations. As a result no further improvement in plantation is made. There the development of tea can be undertaken. I only suggest this to our Finance Minister. When you are giving relief to coffee why are you not giving relief to tea which is earning much more foreign exchange? I humbly urge our Finance Minister to see to it and remove this burden on common tea. Now I would like to say a word about betelnut. There is taxation on betelnut which is imported. In my part large quantities of betelnuts are being smuggled. So there was a representation from that area saying that betelnut should also come within the purview of customs duty and that part should be declared a port. A representation was made to the Finance Ministry as also the Commerce and Industry Ministry but nothing is done. I urge upon them to see to this whether smuggling which is giving no benefit to the Government and which is going to be increased cannot be stopped. Though our land customs department is there it cannot deal with smuggling effectively. Smuggling is going on. So if you want to stop it some definite steps should be taken and the representation which was made from that part should be given due consideration. Now some other friend also touched upon rural economy and cottage and village industries. One thing we must do. That is we must remove the disparity between the town and the village. If we are to remove it what should be done? We should develop small industries village industries and cottage industries. How can they be developed? For that power should be there. Now my hon’ble friend was saying that out of six lakhs of villages only 19000 villages have been electrified. This is meagre. If village electrification is not given due consideration we cannot make progress. When our Draft Five Year Plan was discussed among Members of Parliament I asked for information about how much of village electrification was contemplated in the Third Five Year Plan. The answer was very unsatisfactory. Unless you develop your village industries how can you advance? They are also contemplating to employ the surplus labour and also agricultural peasants who are not wholly employed to develop village industries and to make a plan. But unless power is supplied unless you have a good scheme of rural electrification how can village industries be developed in these modern days? We say big things. We say here and we shout from housetops that so much is being done for the rural areas. But actually we are not doing what should be done. If rural electrification is there then rural industries can be developed. Otherwise they cannot be developed. Unemployment cannot be solved. The only solution for unemployment is the development of small industries and cottage industries. Otherwise unemployment will increase year by year and there will be frustration among young men particularly among the educated.",
15: "Sir before the House adjourned for lunch yesterday I had started speaking on the Essential Commodities Amendment Bill. I have got here with me the Bill as introduced. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons the Government pointed out that in certain cases it might be necessary for them not to award punishment prescribed in the law as it exists at present but to forfeit a part of the deposit. This relates to minor offences under the Essential Commodities Act. I can quite understand this and generally therefore nobody would oppose this thing but the question that I wish to raise in this connection before the House is the manner in which this Act is being implemented by the Government and also by the State Governments because here is a measure which is sponsored by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and in regard to many aspects of which I believe the Central Government has concurrent jurisdiction but much is left to the States. Our experience has been especially in the State from which I come namely West Bengal that this Act is not implemented properly by the State authorities because of various connections of certain people high up with the big business and others indulging in speculation hoarding and so on. The result has been that whatever should be done had not been done. The Central Government has got powers under this Act to make rules to give directions to the States and to supervise the manner in which the particular measure is administered by the States. We found that much that should have been done was not done. What is the use of talking about the punishment of the small fry? Certainly if they are guilty they have to be punished and the smaller the fry the minor should be the punishment. I agree there but the point is that the Act is not properly implemented. We should like to know from the Government as to how many cases have been started under the Essential Commodities Act. We know that foodgrains had been hoarded speculation had been indulged in stocks had been removed from one State to another surreptitiously by unfair and illegal methods. These should have attracted the attention of the Essential Commodities Act. The Act was passed in this Parliament with a view to putting a check on speculative rise in prices. When it came to the question of practical implementation of this measure we found that the Government had failed. Now Government should say something about it. When Government seeks to amend an Act it should tell us as to how the parent Act which is proposed to be amended has been implemented. Is it the contention of the Government that difficulty arises because this particular provision is not there in the Act? Are Government in trouble because they do not know how to deal with the smaller fries? Or is it because that those who are supposed to administer this measure at the State level at the district level have thought it fit to ignore it have thought it fit to by-pass it? If any measure of the Central Government was needed for controlling the price of foodgrains and ensuring the supply of essential commodities to the community it is the Essential Commodities Act. I would like the Minister to say something on this. I know that he was not here at the time when we passed this measure nor was he there when the Essential Commodities Act was by-passed by many State Governments. In the past we had drawn the attention of the Minister to this problem and that Minister is now happily going to be the President of the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee but there I would like to ask the Minister who has stepped into his shoes as to what he is doing in order to see to the proper implementation of this Act. How many prosecutions have taken place? The small people of course should be dealt with very mildly I agree and I support the measure but taking the law as it is today without this amendment it empowers Government to deal very effectively so far as the provisions of the law go with the big traders wholesalers and profiteers. I would like to know as to how they have dealt with them. How many are in jail today? How many have paid fine? How many have suffered imprisonment? How many licences have been cancelled as a result of malpractices corruption profiteering and so on all of which are provided for under this Bill? We are entitled to know. Take us into your confidence in regard to this matter. I say from whatever knowledge we have that very few have been prosecuted under this Act. If it is so it is not because our blackmarket trade has suddenly become whitemarket trade or those impious people have suddenly become virtuous with the succession in the office of the Food Minister by a new man.",
16: "The next question that I would like to deal with is the paragraph in the President’s Address relating to the progress made in our economy in our agricultural sector in our industrial sector in our foreign trade etc. Sir you were pleased to read out to us a very large list of the achievements of the Congress Government during the last decade and the important targets which have been achieved during the last ten years of our planned economy. You also mentioned the question of increase in food production increase in the production of agricultural commodities etc. Fortunately Sir here we have in our midst the ex-Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Shri V.T. Krishnamachari who has addressed a number of meetings and seminars in New Delhi recently drawing our attention to the weakness in our agricultural sector. If the press reports are correct in one seminar he mentioned that even if all the targets of the Third Five Year Plan are achieved still at the end of the Third Five Year Plan period we may be facing a serious situation regarding the supply of agricultural commodities. He has also expressed the hope that we will be able to exceed the targets which have been fixed for the Third Five Year Plan. I do not know whether his expectation of exceeding the targets will be fulfilled or not but it is quite clear that we have not been able to give sufficient attention to the development of the agricultural sector. It has also been stated that development of the agricultural sector is one of the most difficult tasks tasks which have been found difficult both by democratic countries as well as by countries in which total planning is going on. It is all the more reason therefore that we should pay more attention to the agricultural sector so that it may be possible for us to meet our requirements as and when they arise and the situation which he has foreseen at the end of the Third Five Year Plan may not materialise. It is no use merely taking refuge behind some of the figures which have been complied and narrating the progress which has already been achieved. We are happy that some progress has been achieved but we are anxious that more progress should be there and for that purpose also certain definite steps will be taken. In this connection I am also happy to hear what the Defence Minister said yesterday in one of his public meetings namely that the Government of India is contemplating to create a set-up in our villages wherein our panchayats will be functioning more or less on the lines of Parliament. Unfortunately he did not elaborate that point further and the press has not thrown any more light on what that exactly means. But if it means that the panchayats will be in charge of the resources that are available in the villages that they will be in a position to determine how best the productive efforts in the villages are to be directed and in what direction determine what targets are to be achieved and when the production is there and there is a surplus to be exchanged with other centres in the country that the panchayats will have their say in the matter on what terms this surplus will be exchanged with other centres in the country then I think a very valuable step forward in the direction of building our economy on a decentralised basis will have been taken. We have always taken the view Sir that if planning is to succeed in our country and if there is not going to be any regimentation of our productive activity and forces what is necessary is that the common man should have a voice in determining the economic policies and in formulating the economic plans of development and should have also his say in determining on what terms a village or a group or an industry should be working for the development of economy as a whole. In other words some amount of competition some amount of bargaining power is to be generated in the lowest strata of our society and in the lowest rung of our economy so that with the help of that bargaining power under the overall influence and policy of the Planning Commission it may be possible for us to develop our economy in a manner which satisfies both the interests and the requirements of the nation as well as the aspirations of the people. When people feel that they also have their say in the formulation of policies and programmes and that such policies and programmes are not something which is dictated from New Delhi but are those which have been worked out by their own efforts and as a result of their own deliberations to that extent these plans are a part of their efforts in the development of their regions of their own crafts their own industries and their own skills.",
17: "Mr. Vice Chairman I rise to associate myself fully with the Resolution and the concern which has been expressed from all the various sections of the House regarding the urgent necessity of developing rural industries. As time passes by we are reaching a situation in our rural areas where something desperate needs to be done immediately if we want to preserve the social stability of the country and also to see that full use is made of the time and talent of the people in the rural areas which go waste today as has been pointed out in the Resolution. Sir the Planning Commission and the Government of India have applied their minds to the various isolated aspects of rural industries and some valuable reports have been published and some important recommendations have been made in these reports which need consideration. But unfortunately there is no high level decision regarding the various issues which face the country as far as the problem of rural industrialisation is concerned. We are not quite clear as to what first of all rural industries mean and what rural industrialisation implies. Does rural industrialisation mean the utilisation of local resources in order to meet the local needs? Or does rural industrialisation imply the creating of surplus in the rural areas which could be exchanged with the surplus in other centres of the country and thereby to create a richer life for the rural areas? Various opinions have been expressed with regard to this problem but there is no authoritative determination of the policy regarding the meaning of rural industrialisation. It has been suggested that if such import of capital and skill from urban centres were to mean merely the multiplication of industrial centres in the rural areas such an industrialisation of the rural areas would nullify the advantages that are likely to accrue as a result of the rural industrialisation. The time has come when some decision has to be taken as to what we really mean by this rural industrialisation. There is also difference of opinion regarding the authority that should undertake the responsibility for this rural industrialisation. From the literature that has been published in this connection it is quite obvious that two distinct and powerful schools have developed regarding this issue. On the one hand there are people who believe that the task of rural industrialisation should be entrusted to the village panchayats. Since they represent the village people and they have the resources and the powers to raise the necessary resources from the rural areas the panchayats it is felt are the competent authorities to deal with the problem of rural industrialisation. Equally strongly it has been argued by others that cooperatives are the right answer to the question as to which should be the authority that should deal with rural industrialisation. I may also mention that there is a third school which believes that the import of private capital and private skill into the work of rural industrial development is the real answer to the problem which we face in the matter of rural industrialisation. Here again some authoritative determination of the policy has become necessary because in the absence of such a policy ad hoc decisions are taken which sometimes cancel each other and therefore the rapid progress which we hope and wish for in rural industrialisation becomes impossible. Then again there is the further question of protection that may be necessary for rural industries in view of the lack of the internal economy from which rural industries would suffer whatever may be the answer to the first two questions. Prof. Malkani has already referred to this question and various suggestions have been put forward. But all these suggestions require some detailed consideration as there are a large number of difficulties in implementing any one of these suggestions. Demarcation of markets and the imposition of taxes in order to see that goods from the urban centres do not reach the rural centres in unfairly competitive conditions are some of the suggestions that have been made. One great advantage of a vast country is the large number of markets that are available for the goods that are produced in the country. However if these markets are artificially restricted and goods are not allowed to move from one centre to another I am afraid more problems would be raised than solved if this protection is sought to be given in this manner. Yet protection has to be given to the rural industries if these rural industries are to develop. Therefore serious and competent thinking is necessary in this connection and again time is running fast. Therefore it is desirable that we should have some authority which could examine the various issues involved and determine the policy with regard to this matter also.",
18: "Mr. Vice Chairman I wish the matter had not come up for discussion in this House in the form in which it has come because we will be discussing it appears the same subject more or less piecemeal in connection with the other two Bills as well. What was necessary for the Government in this connection was to provide for a general discussion on the report of the Finance Commission the kind of thing that we have on such reports and after hearing the views of the Members here they should have formulated a Bill. Even if they had formulated the Bill earlier the Bill should have been preceded by a discussion on the report. It would then have given us an opportunity of dealing with this rather important subject in our public finance and indeed in our national life. But now we are asked to treat this matter piecemeal and deal with the Bill as it comes separately. I say Sir this would not seem very fair. It is true that we have had two other Reports of the Finance Commission and that we have had certain opportunities of discussing the issues raised by the Finance Commission on previous occasions. But that should not have precluded a thorough discussion of the Third Report more especially after the experience of the two five year plans and generally also after the experience of the States in the matter of public finance and as regards relations between the States and the Centre. All I can say is that the Government does not understand the magnitude of the problem or the urgency or the seriousness of the issues involved. It is possibly because they think that all the State Governments are under their control and that the State Governments would toe the line whatever is laid down from here. Suppose Sir today a number of States had been outside the control of the same party which controls the Central Government problems would have become acute because conflicts between the State Governments controlled by certain other parties and those controlled by the Congress Party which controls the Central Government would have arisen sharply calling for a thorough discussion and mutual consultation in a different way. Once they can get passed whatever they like and also once it is passed the States will more or less accept without any protest the dispensation of the Centre. Now that the Bill is before us we have to speak on this subject rather on the general themes. Yet I would like to make certain general observations in this connection because the basis of the Bill is the Report of the Third Finance Commission. This is a long standing issue facing the public finance of the country. Those who have studied Economics will know well how this matter had come up even during the British time when we did not have either independence or any kind of autonomy in the States even in that set-up. Even at that time the State Governments functioning under the British felt that something should be done with regard to the relations between the Centre and the States. There had been a long-standing controversy as to how the taxes especially the income-tax should be divided between the Centre and the States. I do not deny the existence of the controversy and this controversy is not easy to resolve. I entirely agree. But I should have thought that the Third Finance Commission should be tried to face the problems before it not more or less in a routine manner but in the context of the new things not only as they are today but as they are going to shape in the coming future. We have got what is called a quasi-federal Constitution. I do not say federal Constitution although the spirit is there but a Quasi-Federal Constitution because most of the powers many of the powers that should remain with the States are now in the hands of the Central Government. Therefore in that way it is more Unitary in character than federal. At the same time structurally speaking we have got the State Assemblies Legislatures State Budgets and so on. They function more or less in the same way. But if you go a little deeper into the affairs it would immediately lead you to think that the States do not have any substantial real power especially in the matter of finance. Perhaps at the time when the Constitution was framed this aspect did not figure very much in the minds of the makers of the Constitution. We had just become free and the concept of welding India into a solid nation was uppermost in the minds of those people who framed the Constitution and all others as well. In that background it was quite understandable that it should be the dominant thought as to how to put the put the different segments of our country into a whole namely the Indian Union.",
19: "Sir I would like to make a few observations so that the hon’ble Minister will make a note about the way in which these institutions are being run. It is a good thing that these institutions have been started. But at the same time we are suffering from lack of co-ordination in regard to our technical education. We have certain institutes like the polytechnic etc under the Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs Ministry and they are run through the State Governments. Then there are the engineering colleges under the universities and thirdly Sir trade technical education is imparted by the Central Labour Ministry at the State level. In addition to that the States have certain arrangements of their own for technical education. I feel that there is no effort at co-ordination and that leads to a good deal of confusion. Perhaps if there is effort there are certain difficulties. I hope the hon’ble Minister will tell us about that. I would also like to suggest that even in these four institutions as for some time the medium of instruction would be English for emotional integration an attempt should be made to take a few students from the neighbouring region or other regions on a reciprocal basis. Otherwise these institutes will themselves be developing as was hinted by the previous speaker some regional consciousness. There is great difficulty Sir with regard to technical personnel for teaching and I am not aware in what way these institutes will be staffed. Perhaps some foreigners will be brought in but at the same time with the arrangements existing at present for taking technical help from different countries – Russia U.K. U.S.A. and Germany I do not know whether there will be special courses provided in these Institutes. For the teaching staff from those different countries what arrangements there are one does not know. In the present arrangement for teaching I should have liked to mention the fifth arrangement for teaching at present provided through the various industrial concerns like Bhilai Rourkela etc. All these big concerns have their big technical schools and they take their students for post-graduate work as also for research work. What will therefore happen with regard to the standard is a question. Sir we are not at all sure in our country about the correct use of terms. I would for instance mention here the word ‘polytechnic’. They have one school and even if there is arrangement for starting another subject no effort is made and no sooner they feel they should give out proper enquiries with regard to the possibilities for employment and the various mineral resources etc. and the basic education that should enable the students to enter the polytechnics to have the training where it is available these polytechnics are started. Similarly there is some confusion about the use of the word ‘university’. We have the Roorkee University for one subject i.e. engineering. So it seems there is going to be one university for one faculty. We have one music university also in Madhya Pradesh. We are going to start I am told perhaps a university only for agriculture. So if these institutes are there which term seems to be really the appropriate word in place of these one-faculty universities I think the hon’ble Minister should take the initiative in determining what should be the exact connotation of these terms. Otherwise one day as was pointed out there will be perfect confusion. There comes also the question of the recognition of the degree given by these Institutes. Of course if the training with the special facilities available and the specially recruited staff available is of a high standard naturally people who have passed out from there. In the beginning there will not be any trouble with regard to making use of the graduates turned out from there. But the question of recognition has to be decided on certain principles and those principles should be laid down and followed from the beginning. Now I would like also to mention the question about scholarships. It was pointed out that certain scholarships especially to the children of the working class should be given. I would like to point out here that there is already provision for that and it is not something new. What I would like to stress is that scholarships should be in larger numbers. The scholarships do not seem to be adequate for the rising standard of living and the cost of living. The scholarships that are given do not meet half the need. There is yet another matter which the hon’ble Minister is the proper person to enquire about and that is the merit scholarships that are available in different States to students for technical subjects or to other students who pass with very high marks are not given by the States if they read outside the State.",
20: "Mr. Deputy Chairman Sir I extend to this resolution my whole-hearted support though I wish he had extended its scope by incorporating within it two more services but then I cannot deal with that subject now. You have assured me that the matter will be taken up on a subsequent occasion. I do not know when that subsequent occasion is likely to occur. Sir I am grateful to the Home Minister for some kind words he has said about me in regard to my interest in this subject. No doubt for long I have been urging the necessity of creating more all-India Services. During the last five years or so ever since that recommendation on the subject was made by the States Reorganisation Commission and during the last one year and a half near about that time I have been tabling Resolutions on the subject twice or thrice but they could not come up. Of course as they say there are higher forces that govern the destiny of things and so far as Parliament is concerned it is the Government and the undisputed sway of the Chair that govern the density of Resolutions. Obviously it was so ordained that this Resolution should come up only now and that too as a Government-sponsored Resolution. Even as it is I welcome it most heartily and feel enthusiastic and even jubilant about it. Sir I sincerely congratulate the hon’ble the Home Minister for the tact the firmness the strength and the determination which he has shown in overcoming all the delicacies and difficulties which I am sure were there in his way. The opposition and unwillingness of the States were there initially I know. And I also know Sir that about a year ago when I tabled a question on this subject the then Home Minister told us that the Government would be only too glad to have more all-India Services but then the handicap in their way was that the States were not agreeable to it. Subsequent to that Sir about the middle of this year I wrote to all the Chief Ministers requesting them to let me know their views on this subject and I was a little unhappy to find that no Chief Minister replied to me saying that he was agreeable to it. One or two of them especially said that they were against it. So all these difficulties were there in the way of the Home Minister. But I find that by his sweet persuasion he has been able to win over all the Chief Ministers who in the conference immediately preceding the last one agreed to it in principle and in the subsequent conference they agreed to it it appears obviously in toto and hence we have before us this Resolution supported by the Chief Ministers of all the States. Sir for that I want to congratulate most sincerely and heartily the hon’ble the Home Minister. Now Sir so far as the merits of this Resolution are concerned. I do not think it is necessary for me to elaborate on them because during the last four years or so ever since the publication of the Report of the States Reorganisation Commission many eminent men all over the country eminent administrators and persons who had experience of administration including the retired comptroller and Auditor General were of the opinion that more all-India Services should be created. Our Hon’ble the Prime Minister as also our Vice-President have on more than one occasion expressed themselves definitely in favour of having more all-India Services. Last year Sir about the month of October when addressing the Indian Police officers when they were going out after having had their training for a year he expressly said that if national integration was to be maintained it was necessary to have more all-India Services. That being so I think there is not much need for us to emphasise the necessity and the utility for having more all-India Services. Sir in the interest of efficiency and also in the interest of integrity it is absolutely necessary that we should have these three all-India Services as also some other. The major problem these days before us is that successful implementation of the development programmes has to be carried through. It is not enough that we should have big schemes. It is not enough that we should allocate large sums for the implementation of those schemes. But it is necessary that we should have competent personnel to effectively implement our schemes so that in a short time we may be able to carry forward our country to economic prosperity all around. In the past during the pre-Independence period we had quite a number of all-India Services but then when we framed our Constitution we dispensed with the others retaining only two. It appears to me that necessity has now arisen for reorganisation of the all-India Services and to have more all-India Services.",
21: "Now coming back to the question of minorities you will please find why this particular Resolution has been so widely put in that it might include a religious minority as well a linguistic minority as well or an economic minority as some hon’ble Members rightly pointed out. Now Sir a question arises whether there ought to be any such protection in so far as a particular type of minority is concerned. I shall deal with the question of minorities at some length. But you will please find Sir what the hon’ble mover wants is that there ought to be endowed with statutory powers. Therefore Sir an attempt is being made for the first time by my hon’ble friend for driving a wedge between a community and a community. So far as the Constitution is concerned as my hon’ble friend rightly pointed out whenever the question of minorities arises we have to be extremely careful. The Constitution is a very sacred document which has embodied all the different aspects of the common question of India’s nationality. India is one in spite of different types of languages and religions. But in the midst of all these diversities we have to develop a common nationality. Therefore whenever we consider the question of the development of the nation and the interest of the nation you cannot afford to think in terms either of religion or of language. It is true Sir that there are different religions. It is also true that there are different languages. Therefore a question arose and the framers of the Constitution had to devise a Constitution in the midst of the unity of India with certain diversities here and there. For that purpose what they did was they devised a common nationality for the whole of India and in so far as religious minorities were concerned they were given certain rights. I would not go into the details regarding the provisions of the Fundamental Rights regarding the practice of religion. Certain rights have been given to the religious minorities and beyond that it would not be proper to bring in the religious minorities for political rights. For that we have to be extremely careful. I would also point out that while we have to develop a common nationality the members of the Indian nation have to understand that we are one nation. Therefore certain rights in respect of religious minorities were given. They were Fundamental Rights and most of them are justiciable rights. Here we stopped so far as the religious rights were concerned. Then a question arose what ought to be the attitude of not only the Government but the society regarding the languages. It was true that there were certain interests of the regional languages. Now these languages required to be developed but they were not meant for dividing one man from the other. So in 1956 when the States were formed to a certain extent on the basis of language what was done was not to have a State with cent per cent people belonging to the regional language because there were bound to be people belonging to different languages. That was the reason why this question was considered at great length and the States Reorganisation Commission also went into this question of linguistic minorities. It was bound to arise here and there because they were likely to feel that their rights and safeguards given to them might or might not be properly implemented. So this question was considered first by the States Reorganisation Commission and they dealt with the question whether we should have a permanent Minorities Commission. They went into it very carefully and shrewdly. They found out that it would not be proper to set up a permanent Minorities commission because the result if not the actual effect would be that a permanent wedge would be driven between one community and another community. So far as language minorities were concerned they had a right so far as their own languages were concerned. They had also an obligation to understand the language of the majority in the particular State. It is only by thus coming together that the members of the two language groups would come together and would harmoniously develop but it was found at the time when the States Reorganisation Commission had to consider this that some machinery should be devised for safeguarding the rights of linguistic minorities only and after full consideration what was conceded was that only in respect of linguistic minorities certain rights should be extended and certain rights should be safeguarded and an officer should be appointed by the President for making a report on the question whether these rights of the linguistic minorities are or are not properly safeguarded.",
22: "Coming to the internal affairs of the country Madam Deputy Chairman the policies of the Government of India for the last fifteen years have been so manipulated that the rich people are becoming richer and the poorer sections of the people are becoming still poorer. The committee that has been appointed to investigate into the question of the distribution of income has not yet given its verdict but it is common knowledge that the people who are in the higher-ups have become more rich and the people in the lower rung have become poorer. The prices of essential commodities that the peasants and the workers use have gone up so high that they are not within the reach of the mass of the people of the country. Government have not taken adequate steps to bring down the prices and to stabilise the prices as was recommended by the Foodgrains Committee. We are now in the Third Plan. While the plans are progressing the number of the unemployed in the country is increasing. This is a very anomalous position. It is the Government alone that can explain why in spite of the Plans the unemployment problem is becoming more and more acute. As was rightly pointed out yesterday by some speakers our agriculture has not been paid due attention that should have been paid to in a country where 80 per cent of the people live on land. Some three of four years back when Mr. Ajit Prasad Jain was the Food and Agriculture Minister he was made to resign under shady circumstances as one who had proved not capable of solving the food problem in the country a suggestion was thrown that the portfolio of Agriculture should be handled by an important and senior Member of the Cabinet and particularly in the States by the Chief Ministers of the States. But nothing of the sort has happened. Whatever increase in foodgrains output we have obtained is not because of any increase in the yield per acre but because of extensive cultivation more land has been brought under cultivation and some irrigation facilities have now been provided. But the increase that we have seen is not in keeping with the demand that is necessary for us to feed 400 millions in India. So whatever industrial development we want the basic factor is that our agricultural economy should be improved. For that all efforts should be made more fertilisers should be used and new methods of cultivation should be employed for growing more food crops and for growing other cash crops. In a review that was published by the Planning Commission itself they have pointed out that there is acute shortage of power in more than 50 per cent of the States in India. We have accepted a planned economy we have completed two Plans and we are now in the Third Plan. I do not know why the Planning Commission or the planners concerned did not foresee this shortage of power in most of the States in India and why they did not plan generation of more power so that people will not accuse the State Governments or the Planning Commission that they did not work out the plans properly in order to have more industries and to have more foodgrains produced through lift irrigation. In most of the States- in Andhra in West Bengal in Bihar in Karnataka – power shortage whatever power is available now is being rationed. There are thousands of units of small scale industries which are not working for want of power and there are thousands of lift irrigation pumps which are denied power supply for purposes of irrigating their lands and wherever power is supplied it is during nights which is not very convenient to make use of the power and use the power for agricultural purposes. The Finance Minister in the statement that he made in the Lok Sabha and which was placed before us has stated that it was assessed that for the successful implementation of the Plan even after taking every possible measure for the development of our exports which clearly must be given the highest priority we would need external assistance of the order of Rs. 2600 crores and we have however been less successful in obtaining and utilising the external assistance required for financing the imports necessary for our developing economy. To industrialise our country and to bring it on par with other well developed countries we do need assistance – financial technical and other assistance. The Finance Minister was so hopeful that he was getting Rs. 2600 crores of foreign aid from Aid India Club and other countries. But now he is not hopeful of getting that amount which is necessary to fulfil the targets in the Third Five Year Plan.",
23: "Madam Deputy Chairman when the house rose for lunch I was discussing the response of the public to the loan programme of the Government and was trying to point out that it was rather a serious tendency in the sense that the response of the public had been proved to be poorer during the Tenth Plan period than during the Ninth Plan period. I was trying to point out that looking to the fact that the national income was rising and the people were becoming more conscious of a developing economy and the need to mobilise the resources more and more a contrary trend ought to have appeared and that in view of that this trend was disturbing. This trend is to be contrasted with the trend of the public regarding the call from the corporate sector for the investment of their moneys. Here we find that the shares of some of the new companies or of the old companies that are issuing new shares are over-subscribed at times to the extent of fifteen times the capital that has been asked for by the companies. So here are two pictures; one the picture of the Government asking the public to subscribe to the public loans and the other the picture of the response of the public to the corporate sector demanding investments form the public. While on the one hand there is an enthusiastic response to the demand from the corporate sector on the other there is a very poor response as far as the loan programme of the Government is concerned. This is a matter of some concern and I feel that the Government should pay more attention than just exhorting the people to save more and to hand over their savings to the Government as the hon’ble Finance Minister has done more than once. If it would have been merely a question of rediverting the money that is coming from the corporate sector to the public exchequer in the form of loans perhaps the matter would not have been so serious. Then it would have been just a question of re-allocation of the functions between the public sector and the private sector. But I feel that there is a large amount of money which is just changing to some lucrative channel and that explains why the response to the demand from the corporate sector is fifteen times. This shows that fourteen times that particular capital is not required by that company and if there had been some adequate step or measure whereby originally that money could have gone to the public exchequer to that extent there would not have been any disappointment to the people who wanted shares but who did not get them and disappointment to the public exchequer by not getting the response which it ought to have got. That to my mind leads to the question of the pattern of the rate of interest. In a developing economy and especially in view of the fact that a large number of companies are being floated today which have got an element of growth in them thereby attracting so much capital towards them the Government of India will to take into consideration the question of the rate pattern of interest on their loans and to see whether something could not be done whereby the public will be attracted to a large extent towards their loan programme that Hitherto. It has appeared in the press that the question of supply and want is being reconsidered and that offers are sought to be made more attractive. If in the same strain the entire question of the loan programme is also considered it may be possible that these loans also might be made more attractive and thereby more capital which is today just changing the channels of profitable employment might be diverted to the public exchequer in the form of public loan. Then there is the question of the State Governments performing their part which has been assigned to them during the Eleventh Plan period. In this connection I would like to draw the attention of the hon’ble House to a very important recommendation which has been made by the Eleventh Finance Commission namely the appointment of a high-power commission to go into the entire question of the allocation of financial resources between the Central Government and the State Governments. They have argued the whole case in nearly one and a half pages in order to show why it has now become necessary that a high-power commission should be appointed to go into this important question. According to the Third Finance Commission the allocation of resources between the centre and the states was made at a time when planned economic development was not visualised. When the constitution was framed the development of the public sector the new responsibilities which the states were going to assume and a Plan era were not properly visualised and it was under these conditions that these allocations were being made.",
24: "Madam Deputy Chairman I rise to support the Bill which has been moved by the hon’ble Minister of State in the Ministry of Home Affairs. This Bill incorporates certain sentiments which the country holds so dear as far as the office of President is concerned and also incorporates the faith of the people in themselves that when they will elect a President the person who would be occupying the high post would be a person who would have not only the love and affection of the people but would be as the hon’ble Minister pointed out a dedicated politician whose whole life is dedicated to the service of the nation before he became the President during his occupation of the President and even after he retired from that office. It is this confidence of the people in themselves and the high love and affection which they hold for this office which have resulted in this particular bill being considered by the House at the present moment. The hon’ble Minister has pointed out that the President who has just retired has fulfilled all the requirements which are the basis of this particular measure and the measure which was passed in 2001. I wish that he had mentioned the last Governor General also to whom both the measures apply. Whether we may agree or may not agree with the last Governor-General on some of the political views that the holds there can be no two opinions that the last Governor- General was also an illustrious son and is an illustrious son of this country and deserves all the consideration all the love and all respect of the country which are being incorporated in the present measure and were incorporated in the 2001 Act. While therefore fully supporting the measure which is now before the House I would like certain clarifications regarding the rules that are going to be made for giving effect to the provisions which have been incorporated in the present Bil. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons we are told that a person holding the high office of President has even after retirement many public calls on him and it is therefore considered desirable to provide him with secretarial staff. It is further stated that the bill provides for a staff which may be engaged for the President. Staff might be appointed for him and office space might be provided for him. It is because of this that certain misgivings have arisen in the minds of some of the members and they want it to be made perfectly clear that the staff will be appointed by the ex-President and it will be his wishes and his desires that will be taken into account when a particular person is being appointed. Also regarding the office which is engaged for him his wishes should be taken into account so that he knows what would be a convenient place for him and he may try to get that place. Another reason for insisting on what I consider to be an important detail is that if the Government appoints the staff for the ex-President then automatically they become Government servants because they have been appointed by the Government. It may be that in the rules a clarification might be attempted whereby they may be exempted from some of the Service Conduct Rules which are applicable to normal Government Servants. But even there it will be much better that this should not be left in any doubt and that these persons that are appointed to assist the ex-President in this secretarial task are appointed by the ex-President himself. They would be the staff of the ex-President and would not be appointed by the Government for the ex-President and would not be Government servants. This point ought to be made quite clear so that the ex-President has got all the right of determining the service conditions of the people appointed by him of course subject to the overall limit which has been provided and to my mind rightly provided in the bill. Within that overall limit perhaps it will be much better to leave the rest of the matter to the president himself so that we may also express our further confidence in the President to the effect that he would utilise it with discretion and with all sense of responsibility and fairplay and taking into account the interests of the public and of the public exchequer too. Another point which also needs some clarification is regarding the payment to be made for the secretarial assistance and for the secretarial staff. Normally Government rules required that whenever any such demand is made on the public exchequer or on the Consolidated Fund of India a certain formality has to be gone through and that formality of accounting has to be in a prescribed form.",
25: "Mr. Vice-Chairman first of all I must place of record my grateful thanks to the University Grants Commission for the work that they have done for the advancement of higher education. They have done good work and in full co-operation with the Education Ministry. This I think must encourage State Governments to establish university grants commissions or committees in their respective states. What the country needs most is the coordinated efforts of the autonomous university grants commissions working in harmony with the State Governments and university authorities. Coordinated efforts are needed to bring about certain uniformity in the standards of university education. Without that our educational advancement is bound to suffer from various tensions and difficulties. I do agree with my friend that the Annual Report under discussion is rather a dull report. At least it is not as bright as the two previous Reports were. In the previous two reports the University Grants Commission invited the attention of the nation to certain educational needs. Unfortunately in this Report the University Grants Commission confines its remarks mostly to what has been achieved in the field of university education under the guidance and with the assistance of the University Grants Commission. However Sir It is not possible for me to agree with Mr. Santhanam that the University Grants Commission should not extend help to universities for the preservation of manuscripts. Manuscripts are of great importance so far as university libraries are concerned. It is the duty of universities to preserve those manuscripts and it is the duty of the University Grants Commission to extend to universities the necessary financial assistance for maintaining and preserving manuscripts in good order. Also it is not possible for me Sir to agree with my friend that today universities are enjoying too much of autonomy. I agree with the University Grants Commission which two years ago remarked that freedom is vital for education and democracy and I personally feel Sir that on one plea or the other university autonomy and academic freedom are being restricted rather than being extended as they must be. I do not think Sir that a social purpose or a social value can be imparted in the teaching by a teacher through the imposition of restrictions on his freedom of thinking. I feel that teachers need academic freedom for discharging their duties in an efficient way. If we take into consideration the affiliated colleges we will notice that the teachers are subjected to such humiliating conditions that it is not possible for them to discharge their duties to their students to impart to their students any sense of responsibility or any moral values in their lives. I therefore Sir feel that it is necessary to be more careful about the preservation of academic freedom to teachers. Sir we are grateful to the Education Ministry and to the University Grants Commission for upgrading the salaries of teachers in the Central universities. Yet a great disparity prevails in the salaries of teachers of Central Universities and State Universities and affiliated colleges and this disparity is causing a lot of heart-burning and a lot of difficulties. As one connected with education I may say that there is not such a marked difference in the quality of teachers serving in the Central Universities and in the State Universities and in affiliated colleges as to justify the great disparity in the salaries of teachers of these institutions. I feel Sir that we must keep in our mind the remarks of the University Grants Commission made in their earlier Annual Report with regard to teachers salaries. We are not only to provide adequate salaries to teachers of affiliated colleges but also to teachers of secondary schools. We must remember Sir that a great majority of students study in affiliated colleges and the quality of education is largely determined by the quality of work that is done in affiliated colleges. For important in the quality of teaching improvement in living conditions is also very necessary. The University Grants Commission has invited or attention in its Report to the appalling conditions in which teachers have to live. But unfortunately the University Grants Commission has to admit that it does not seem likely that we shall be make anything more than the marginal contribution towards this practical need. I feel that the University Grants Commission should pay more attention to the solution of this problem than has so far been paid by it and the Education Ministry and that the Government should not grudge funds to the University Grants Commission for making adequate arrangements for improving living conditions of teachers who are expected to train the citizens of the country. Sir in the University Grants Commission Report it is maintained that Rs. 12000 should be granted to every affiliated college for the welfare of the teaching staff and that efforts should be made to provide them with quarters and that too in the vicinity of the college where they teach.",
26: "Mr. Vice-Chairman I would now like to make a few observations on the Ministry of Education. Education is basic to any national Regeneration. It is true that it does not bring any return as our other projects do as for instance the steel projects or the irrigation projects do. But this is the investment that is designed to help building up of the human material. It is agreed that education has expanded after independence and during the plan periods. But it is a matter for concern that the content of education has not been equal to our expectations. Even today we are engaged in experimenting with all types of education from the basic stage up to the university level. It is not clear. I presume that the basic pattern of education of which so much was said and written is accepted as a success even today. Where do we stand with regard to the basic pattern? It seems to be the position that all arguments are in favour of that type of education but all proof is against the success of such a type of education. Where does the Government stand with regard to this type of education? We swore by the basic type of education because it was discovered by the Father of the Nation. But if it has been a failure why should not the Government say that that is the position? Then again take secondary education and also collegiate education. Three years ago it was said that all universities should have three year degree courses and some universities which were reluctant to accept this reform were more or less compelled to do so and they accepted it. Now certain universities find that this scheme is not working satisfactorily and they feel that they should have a two-year course in the college before students could enter the degree course. I mention this to show that this eternal tinkering with education should stop and it should not go on like this. This uncertainty is not only with regard to the main objective of education the main structure of education from the primary to the collegiate level but also with regard to the courses of studies and also with regard to the language or medium of instruction. Mr. Chairman up to the secondary stage it has been accepted that the medium of instruction should be the regional language. The National Integration Council however stated that if universities are to exchange professors if they have to develop freely then there should be the common medium of instruction namely English and Hindi. Now at the latest National Integration Council meeting we are told that the medium of instruction in the colleges should also be the regional language ultimately and if that comes to pass I ask how will national integration be achieved? It is permissible to envisage a stage if the scheme of the National Integration Council is implemented where different universities will have different media of instruction and the men that will be drawn from these universities will have to man the judiciary of the land and the all-India services. But they will not be able to serve in a State other than the one in which they were educated. How can integration be achieved? We are working at cross purposes. It is time that a high power body was appointed to hammer out a national scheme of education having integration as the basic aim and to implement it systematically. The present method of meddling at every stage of education the present climate in which we are not clear about the medium of instruction at different stages is causing concern to the parents to the pupils and weakening the country in the process. This is a major problem at this stage of the development of the country. Then Mr. Vice-Chairman I would pass on to the Ministry of Transport and Communications. According to this Ministry we are to build a system of National Highways provincial or State Highways an integrated system of communication form the village upwards but the Central Government is concerned with the construction of National Highways. It is good to have a fine system of National Highways. It also serves as a physical link for integrating the nation. It is good but this planning of construction of National Highways without regard to the development of railways and the development of industries in the regions in which the Highways are proposed to be constructed will be something beyond our means at the present moment. Assuming that we have a network of National Highways are they to be put to immediate use? Are they good investments? Unless you have industries small big or medium coming along the highways unless they assure you a fair return for the investment it is not desirable to have a system of Highways for the sake of mere transport of passengers. In other words we should have a scheme of priorities for the National Highways so that they can be looked after.",
27: "Mr. Vice Chairman Sir I rise to support the Plantations Labour (Amendment) Bill brought up by the Government for our consideration. Sir the sad plight of millions of toiling people who sweat on various plantations in the country to earn valuable foreign exchange for us in really too much to be expressed in words. These workers live and work in most inhuman and pitiable conditions. These plantations include tea coffee cinchona rubber etc. and as we know tea alone is one of the major foreign exchange earners of our country. But Sir it is indeed most regrettable that notwithstanding a lapse of 62 years since our Independence these workers who earn crores and crores of rupees by way of foreign exchange have to live in most miserable conditions. They live in houses that are most insecure and collapse frequently and when these workers die as a result of these collapses their guardians or their dependents do not get even due compensation for the loss that they have to bear. Unhygienic living in distant and far-flung areas compounded with lack of medical and educational facilities make their life utterly miserable. These Plantation workers have to live in abject poverty like slaves of their employers. And as we know most of these plantations are still foreign-owned establishments last vestiges of the colonial rule the British rule and as I said it is a matter of deep regret for all of us that despite enacting an Act the Plantations Labour Act 2001 we have not yet been able to effect any improvement in their condition. I think the employers alone are not responsible for their miserable condition. We are also as much responsible as they are because although we could enforce the enactment and we could improve their conditions much earlier we have failed in doing so. Sir on the 9th May 2003 this House the Rajya Sabha decided that a Joint Committee should be appointed to look into the desired amendment and put up a draft as early as possible for our consideration. On the 26th May 2003 the Lok Sabha also adopted our Resolution our motion with the result that a 45-Member committee in which 15 representatives were from the Rajya Sabha and 30 from the Lok Sabha was appointed to look into the matte. This Committee was to submit its report on the 1st day of the 15th Session of the Rajya Sabha that was in 2003. But this Committee had to be granted these extension and the report was ultimately available on the 3rd March 2005. At that time as we all know the so-called JP’s movement of total revolution was at its peak. Within two or three months the national emergency had to be declared and during the emergency priorities had changed and we could not just effect this desired improvement at that time and we could not bring about this legislation. And then the Janta rule and the Lok Dal rule. For 30 months they were in power but they too-although they try to pose to be the champions of the downtrodden and the workers-filed to deliver the goods and that is why today we are going to consider the report of that committee that was presented to the Government in 2005. Therefore we are also equally responsible for not ameliorating their conditions and their plight. The Committee had to consider 120 memoranda giving views and suggestions from various unions and associations and 59 witnesses appeared before the committee and that committee itself came to the conclusion that in various areas even the barest minimum facilities such as arrangement for supply of wholesome drinking water latrines urinals provision of qualified doctors had not been provided though these amenities are a must under the act. The Act has been there but we could not enforce it; we could not implement it only because the employers did not want it; they did not want to give to the workers due justice. Inadequacy of punishments that are awarded under the Act is one of the main impediments standing in the way of implementation of various welfare measures. Courts generally take a lenient view of the offences under the Act and they let off the employers who are offenders with light punishment which generally amounts to a fine of Rs.100. So the Committee suggested amendment to section 36 of the Act. An employer is required to provide these workers living accommodation but generally in spite of the fact that the Government gives loans and subsidies to the employers for construction of houses progress in regard to these constructions is very poor. As I said earlier very unhygienic and insecure houses are there where these people have to live. Even compensation to the workers in the event of house collapse is not given.",
28: "Mr. Vice-Chairman I was speaking about the need for developing a strong U.N. delegation. I wish that the hon’ble Prime Minister would give his attention to this aspect of the matter particularly in view of the fact that in the next decade or two politics all over the world would take on a complex character and it is necessary that men are trained from now on for taking part in international affairs. In the U.K. and the United States such delegations are built with men who have wide knowledge of international affairs and there should be other qualification for a man to be included in such a delegation. In this connection I should like to mention that it is time for Government to develop sound conventions regarding the conduct of foreign affairs. In the United States they have accepted the principle of bipartisan consultation on important affairs of policy. For example when President Kennedy stood for election President Eisenhower even during the period of the conduct of the campaign of President Kennedy kept him informed about major developments in foreign affairs. We have seen our Government sending troops out of this country to the Congo and at that time I had raised the point that before troops left our country for any assignments of an unusual character like the Congo assignment Members of the Opposition should be informally consulted. There will be no question of any leakage of information whatever if leaders in the Opposition are consulted on important aspects of foreign policy. The Consultative Committee of the External Affairs Ministry does go some way to meet the needs of exchanging information about foreign affairs but the informal consultation of the kind that I mention where the Leader of the Opposition and leaders of other Parties are called and told by the Prime Minister about unusual developments would strengthen the convention that the foreign policy of the country has the support not only of the Congress Party but also of the entire country. I was speaking about our external publicity and it is a subject on which I think I can speak with some confidence as I have been an old time newspaperman in this country. The material which is sent out to foreign countries is extremely scrappy and useless. There is included in these messages some statement of what this Minister was saying somewhere. We are trying to give publicity to ministerial activities and it is inevitable that some such publicity should be given because Ministers are in charge of the Government but one abroad does not get a real idea of what is happening in the country. I would like to suggest for the consideration of the External Affairs Ministry that they should send a fortnightly assessment of what is happening in India written dispassionately not to please a Minister or to highlight something that he has done but to give an objective assessment of what is going on in the country. In the old days when the British Government was in existence such fortnightly reports used to be sent by various State Governments and I think a beginning can be made in that direction in this matter. The other point I would like to suggest is that publicity is a complicated and technical matter. The Foreign Service as it is constituted today does not have sufficient training in publicity. The Estimates Committee which went into the demands of the External Affairs Ministry mentioned about the methods of training which have been adopted but since our Foreign Service men are not trained in publicity work and one sees for example that a lot of confusion has arisen in the United States over Ambassador Nehru’s statement I think the External Affairs Ministry might well set up a Committee of Members of Parliament who are conversant with external publicity and some newspapermen to advise the External Affairs Ministry from time to time. I do not think that the Committee will ask for information which is confidential or secret but they can assist the newspapermen. There are a handful of competent men who would be willing to serve on the Committee in an advisory capacity. They would be able to tell the External Affairs Ministry what should be done in order that our news publicity abroad is better. I might mention also that the Estimates Committee had recommended the creation of a cultural cell. Sir to my mind we have also to be clear in our mind regarding the objective of rural industrialization. Do we mean to have only diversification of rural economy and are we going to have rural industrialisation only in order to give some help to those who find themselves unemployed during a certain period of the year? Are we aiming at utilising local resources and meeting local needs through diversification of rural economy or have we a more fundamental objective in mind when we are trying to industrialise the rural areas? Without this I am afraid rural industrialization will not be possible.",
29: "If you scan the history of the railways in this country you will see that it was the Presidency towns- Bombay Madras and Calcutta- that determined the pattern of our railways as well as of our industrial and economic growth. The British when they landed in this country established trading centres called forts. In Chennai it was Fort St. George; in Kolkata it was Fort St. Williams and in Mumbai it was merely a Fort and there was one in Surat also. It is these trading establishments which determined the pattern of government the pattern of administration and every other pattern under the British regime. They constructed the railways they established the industries they located their armies with reference to these three Presidency towns. This idea of the Presidency towns determining the pattern of our social structure industrial advancement and the system of our railways still persists. That is the mental lag that is hampering the vision of the Planning Commission the Railway Board and the Railways Ministry. Sir once I happened to travel from London to Rome by train. Another time I had to travel from Moscow to Leningrad by train. Nowhere did I find on the continent of Europe lines of varying breadth. It is all a uniform gauge. So is it in Russia- it may be 6 ft. there. In America in every industrially advanced country you find that the gauge is uniform. This very country which ruled us namely the United Kingdom had inside its border a uniform gauge but they inflicted three systems of gauge on India. They thought that that would perpetuate what is called their domination or in the negative sense that it would impede the industrial and economic growth of India. Secondly it would make India always the customer and purchaser of lines and locomotives and rolling stock from the United Kingdom. In the old days I am told it is the Government which built the broad-guage line and it is the private companies that took to this metre gauge and narrow gauge. Though they may not have had the distinction of private and public sector in view then it now appears that what the so-called public sector then did has been good and what the private sector then did has been to our disadvantage. I would appeal to these agencies to introduce a uniform guage throughout India. In this connection it will be interesting to note the talk of the hon’ble Railway Minister about the schools primary schools higher secondary schools and high schools for the Indian Railways. If you examine the previous speech of the Railway Minister and also the working report of the Railway Board you will find that the same figure is repeated every year. I have examined the figures and I find that this year only 16 schools have been added out of which 13 are primary schools one is a higher secondary school and two are middle or high schools. Instead of saying that they have been able only to provide 13 primary schools or one or two more high schools or higher secondary schools the same figures are repeated in the speech. Although the railway Board has all along been saying that education is the responsibility of the State and therefore the Railway Board does not own this responsibility I would like to remind the Railway Minister about the agreement reached between the National Federation of Railwaymen and the Railway Board in the year 2005 according to which the Railway Board undertook to provide primary schools for the education of the children of railway employees. Sir as I told you earlier I had to say many things on the floor of this House but I will conclude with only one or two more observations. I will first deal with the labour relations on the Indian Railways. I slightly differ from my hon’ble Friend when he quoted me as saying that the permanent negotiating machinery has completely failed. It is a fact that this machinery is not functioning satisfactorily. At certain place it has failed. There is no doubt about it. But I would say in this House most frankly that at the Board’s level this machinery has been working successfully. But this is not the position so far as the zonal railways are concerned. I do not say that in all the zonal railways it is so but in certain zonal railways and in most of the divisions of these railways it has failed. I was expecting that the Railway Minister would examine the working of this machinery in all the railways. What is the greatest defect in this machinery? This machinery suffers to the extent that at the board level if there is difference of opinion between the Railway Board and the railway labour no arbitration machinery is provided to settle the disputes. The provision in this machinery is that as and when an occasion arises an Ad Hoc Tribunal would be set up by Government.",
30: "May I Madam draw the attention of the hon’ble Minister to an important Committee set up by the Government of India in 1998 under the chairmanship of Mr. Negi who was asked to enquire into the various problems of railway-road co-ordination? Their preliminary report appeared sometime ago and it was even circulated to all the State Governments for their opinion. But to my regret I have to say that the work of this Committee has been very much hindered as a result of the indifference and may I say callous negligence on the part of the State Governments as well as on the part of the Ministry concerned in taking up this question and in pursuing it so that we may be able to have a clear and comprehensive picture of the transport situation in the country. Now railway transport like any other mode of transport is suffering under a major handicap the handicap being that we do not know nor does the Railway Ministry know what the exact quantum of transport requirement in the country is and what the rising demand is which the Railways are expected to cater to in future. Certain targets which have been worked out in the Tenth Plan have been given to us. In the Ninth Plan we were given certain targets. But unfortunately Madam may I point out that all those targets were either gross under-estimates or exaggerations? Throughout we have seen that we have not been able to have a well-coordinated and progressive development of the transport system and in particular the railway system in the country. So anything we suggest today will have that kind of air of unreality. Without knowing fully or adequately what exactly the transport needs in the country are we are not in a position to discuss or dilate upon the problems of the Railways or the transport itself. Madam last year when I was speaking on the Budget I pointed out that there had been planning of some sort but within this planning there had not been sufficient planning in the functioning of the administration. There has not been planning in carrying out the various phases of the programme enunciated in the plan or in the Budget. Frequently we came across the statement by the hon’ble Minister that the Railways have not been able to fulfil certain things. I went through the pages of the Budget papers and also the speech of the Minister. I came across this significant expression. Wherever there are failures or shortfalls in performance we are told that these are mainly due to unpredictable factors or factors beyond control. I do not think that some of the factors which my hon’ble Friend would like us to believe that they are unpredictable or uncontrollable cannot be anticipated. For instance I may draw the attention of the hon’ble Minister to one important fact that is we have been supplying since some time past empty haulage for a long distance to collieries to steel factories and so on. We are told that this empty haulage is unavoidable that we have to find empty wagons to steel factories and collieries to carry raw material or perhaps coal and the like. So for a long distance we find wagons going empty but if there had been a research cell an organization in the Ministry to find out ways and means of utilising these wagons fruitfully by avoiding bottlenecks in between we could have solved the transport difficulty to a certain extent. I do not want to be told by the Minister that this is a physical impossibility. Even in the advanced countries of the world every movement of wagon coach and engine is planned before it is put into operation. It is unfortunate and tragic that in this country after a decade of planning we have not been able to think in terms of planning while executing the works. Now in regard to some of the general problems of the railways I would say first of all that the rise in demand is so great that we have to be prepared to provide not only adequate but also effective transport facilities to our people. I need not tell the House that the railway transport system in general is greatly dependent or inter-dependent on the general economy of the country. But during the last one decade there has been one significant factor that has to be appreciated that is the demand for transport is increasing at a faster rate than the rise in the national income or the rise in production in any sector or in any industry. This is a factor that has not been adequately appreciated even if it has been adequately appreciated no attempt or sincere effort has yet been made to carry out the fulfilment of the needs of all the sectors of our economy.",
31: "Madam Deputy Chairman the main question for consideration of this House is whether the increase in the passenger fares and in the freights that has been proposed by the Railway Minister should have the support of this House or not. I have been listening with some interest to the speeches so far made and they are all unanimous on one point namely that there should be no increase particularly so far as the second class passengers are concerned. What we have to decide at present is that those friends who have emphasized their opposition to this levy have also said that in view of out developing economy in view of our developing industrialisation in view of the fact that there is a greater demand for passenger traffic as well as goods traffic we have to develop our railway system. We have to see that we increase our lines. We have also to see that we double our lines. We have also to see that the production of the locomotives wagons and coaches is increased with greater rapidity. Otherwise we will not be able to meet the demand of the developing economy. It is also agreed that according to the recommendations of the Pay Commission we all feel that our workers our labourers are entitled D.A. which will be to the tune of Rs 12 crores. There are no two opinions about it. It is also demanded that so far as amenities to the workers are concerned regarding their privileges and concessions or the repairs to the stock are concerned there is very urgent need that we should see that our workers do not strain themselves. An engine driver should not be asked to do work for more than 12 hours. Similarly others in the Railways should also have further concessions so far as leisure rest and leave are concerned. It is also agreed and it has been emphatically stressed on all hands that the second class passengers are not getting amenities which they should get. The greater portion of the income comes from the second class passengers and the position is that they are not getting their dues by way of rest and comfort which are necessary for them. I appreciate that effort is being made that so far as sleeping accommodation and provision of fans to the second class passengers are concerned something is being done. But this does not touch even in fringe of the problem and when we see the second class passengers huddled together like cattle not even having sufficient air to breathe in we feel that there is something seriously wrong with our Railway Administration. We have also to see that the shortage that we had about the supply of wagons to the coal-mines and to our steel industry is not there. Madam it is a strange chain of events that the Minister who was in charge of steel and who gave statements in a way implying that the Railways are not doing their part well is now saddled with that responsibility and I am sure he must feel double responsibility because he knows how the industry has suffered or was likely to suffer. As the Minister of Steel he charged the Railway Ministry of not doing things which should have been done. So now these are the problems that we have to meet and the question arises how to meet them. I quite understand that there could be some economy effected in administration. I could also understand that by tightening the administration and seeing that there is not much of ticketless travel we could improve the position. I could also understand that by taking effective measures regarding the new responsibility which Parliament has placed on the shoulders of the Railway Department namely the liability of a common carrier for goods for which they have provided Rs. 2 crores and by having all these things in mind there could be some reduction in expenditure. But I do not think that reduction would be of a value sufficient to meet the increasing demands of the Railways. That is the problem. It is true that it will be hard to increase any fare. It would be hard to increase any freight. We do realize and we do appreciate it and as representatives of the people we do feel every day that our people are being taxed more and more. As regards freight Madam my own view is that so far as food articles are concerned this proposal should be modified just as there has been a modification in the case of giving encouragement for exports and in certain other respects. Similarly I feel that so far as food articles are concerned the proposal should be modified and on the other things these freights may continue as proposed. In this way the danger that has been pointed out by hon’ble Members and to a certain extent correctly that if the prices of food articles go up that would create difficulty would be avoided.",
32: "Mr. Vice-Chairman knowing the hon’ble Mover of this Resolution to be a good Parliamentarian. I had expected that he would place before the House all sides of this problem. I had expected that he would be no less interested in the efficiency and discipline of the Administration no less interested in the public welfare than in the interest of the civil services. But I am sorry to observe that he has taken only one view of the matter namely the interests of the civil services alone. He has not at all dwelt upon the frightful consequences which a strike of the sort we had the misfortune to have would have had on the country and the people in general. He has spoken no doubt in measured tones unlike the hon’ble Member who sat to his right in the morning and who raised a shout wanting to make up by sound what his arguments lacked in force. I wish to submit to this House that it would be incorrect and it would be imprudent for this House to accept this Resolution. It would be incorrect because by accepting this Resolution we would be laying down something bad in principle and we would also be accepting a policy which would be suicidal and which would cut at the roots of discipline in the services. To the merits of reinstatment or otherwise of these persons I will come later on. I doubt the very propriety of Parliament going into this matter. Now let us see what has happened. Whether right or wrong Departments have taken up the question of these strikers those who took part in this strike those who indulged in disobeying the ordinance; several cases of sabotage and intimidation including criminal ones have been gone into and the authorities have taken some decision. In some cases the Government have taken the decision and in some cases the Departments have taken the decision. Now would it be right for Parliament to intervene to interfere with these decisions? Suppose we do that suppose Parliament interfered with the decisions taken by the Government or by the Heads of Departments tomorrow with what face and with what authority can the Head of a Department extract service from his subordinates? This is the question which hon’ble the mover must see and also the other hon’ble Members who have spoken in support of the Resolution. Unemployment is mounting up and we have not been able to generate enough employment opportunities to provide even for those people who are entering the labour market today perhaps to the extent envisaged during the Tenth Plan. The point that I want to make is that it is not quite justifiable to take only one aspect of the Tenth plan period namely the exigencies of capital mobilization out of the context of the general economic situation in the country. When we are therefore making this huge tax effort we will have to apply our mind with equal seriousness if not more to see that the income generation in the community is as great as is envisaged so that the savings and investments could be effected without disturbing unnecessarily the consumption pattern in the community. Whenever there is any tax on corporations this cry is raised and this cry is always belied by what the industrialists themselves have claimed to be the sensitive barometer to find out the climate for capital formation. I mean the stock exchanges. This time the stock exchanges have reacted quite favourably to the Budget proposals as a whole which clearly shows that whatever else may be the merit of the present Budget proposals it is certainly not anti-capital. Last year also the stock markets boomed up after the taxation proposals were announced. This time though they were a little hesitant at first ultimately I think they have realised that there is nothing wrong with the taxation proposals and they are now merrily mounting up. This is quite natural because there are so many benefits and advantages in our economy today that it is not difficult for the corporate sector to absorb a small rise of five per cent in the corporation tax which has been proposed by the hon’ble Finance Minister. The economy of the nation today is more or less a closed economy because due to the lack of external finances imports have been virtually prohibited. There is a lot of planning in the country which makes risk-bearing rather unlikely and because of the regulation of the economy internal competition is also not very great. The risk-bearing capacity which is claimed by the industrialists really forgetting large profits and large yields on their investment is almost non-existent in our economy today. Our markets are expanding very fast and the money generated is much more than the production of commodities with the result that there are shortages is almost every commodity. It should not be difficult for the industrialist to absorb the small rise of five percent in the corporate tax.",
33: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir the Plantations Labour Bill 1973 was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on the 6th March 1973. Then it was referred to a Joint Committee of both the Houses and this Joint Committee submitted its report in 1975. Now we are discussing this Bill today after six years of the submission of the report by the Joint Committee. Hence the Bill would not be able to deal with the present day expectations of the workers of the plantations. The original Act in regard to the plantation labour namely the Act of 1951 itself provided various welfare measures for the plantation labor. But unfortunately the planters non-chalantly violated all these provisions for welfare measures. The main question therefore is the question of implementation of the provisions of the Act. Mere amendments will not improve the position. There is no provision in the present Bill also as to how these measures these provisions can be implemented and what the Government is thinking in terms of implementing these provisions. In most cases even the Government officials who are deputed for the purpose of inspecting the gardens they themselves side with the planters. If Government officers themselves side with the planters where is the remedy? Hence we should devise ways and means and adopt measures so that the provisions which are made in the Act and the Bill the present Bill are implemented properly. Sir the provisions in the present Bill fall far short of the expectations of the working population in the plantations. In the present Bill it has been suggested that the acreage of the plantations in regard to which this Act will be applied will be reduced to 5 hectares. But this is also not sufficient because under this also the owners the planters will take shelter and many of the plantations will still remain uncovered. This should be further reduced to 2.5 hectares. So far as compensation for house collapse is concerned it has been said here that if the occupant of a house is directly responsible for the collapse he will not be entitled to compensation. Under this provision Sir the employers will take shelter and deprive many workers of getting compensation. Sir it is known to everybody that the plantation industry is the biggest foreign exchange earning industry. The productivity of this industry in India can increase only if the labour are contended. Contended labour alone can improve the efficiency and productivity of the plantation industry. So the need of the hour is not to bring such piecemeal legislation. What is needed today is a comprehensive Bill which should deal with all aspects of the working conditions of the plantation labour. The need of the day is to introduce such a Bill where workers will have full participation in managing the gardens and this plantation industry should be nationalised immediately. Sir Assam is one of the most important tea producing States in the country. There formerly the tea gardens were owned by the Britishers. Now the Indians have purchased those gardens. After these gardens have gone to the hands of the Indian planters the situation has not improved; rather it has deteriorated the efficiency of the gardens has deteriorated. Even the local people and educated tea labour youths are being deprived of getting employment in the gardens. Therefore steps should immediately be taken to nationalise this industry. Here Sir I would like to inform the House that in 1978-79 the rulling Janata Party in the Assam Assembly had adopted a resolution unanimously for nationalisation of tea industry in Assam. If the Government is not willing to nationalise the entire plantation industry I would request that the Government should take early steps at least to nationalise the tea industry in Assam. It is a very vital matter for the economic self-sufficiency of Assam State and it is very important from the point of view of increasing efficiency and productivity of the gardens also. I would like the Government not only to pass this Amendment Bill which I have risen to support but also to ensure its implementation as best as it can; otherwise getting it passes and keeping a copy of it in the library or elsewhere will not improve the conditions of the plantation workers. I want proper implementation proper enforcement of the law and I want that desired amenities and facilities should be provided to these workers and it should be ensured that employers do provide these amenities. When this question of Joint Committee was taken up in this House our late friend Mr. Bhupesh Gupta was there and he also voiced his feelings and said that these plantations should be acquired by the Government. These are generally foreign-owned establishments and they are the centres –at least in Assam –of anti-Indian activities. These plantations deserve to be taken over by the Government as early as possible.",
34: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir I would like to speak on this Bill in the interest of the rapid economic growth in the country. If the nation grows from strength to strength economically leading to eradication of the degrading and disheartening poverty of the people of India the workers of this nation would also benefit and they would also go above the poverty line. Sir I would like to mention here that the plantation crops as understood by the term so far namely coffee rubber tea and cardamom have been giving this nation substantial amount of the much-coveted foreign exchange annually. It must be noted that coffee exports alone have given our country during the last five years over Rs. 1000 crores in foreign exchange by way of export earnings and export duties. I must also bring to the attention of this House that the famed tea industry in India today has become a sick industry affecting lakhs of workers and the tea planters. Sir we ought to know that in the agricultural sector the plantation labour is the best organised one and is getting nearly the same treatment facilities and amenities like the industrial labour. Sir coming from a plantation district of Karnataka I sincerely agree that the welfare measures provided in the Act must be faithfully implemented and strictly enforced. But I cannot subscribe to the view taken by some that the planters generally are exploiters and are inimical to the interests of their own workers and that they must be dealt with severly. Sir most of the planters of today are educated and they know that contended labour is conducive to productivity and peace in the estates and therefore would like to provide all the welfare measures and amenities to the workers. Sir I would like to point out some of the very draconian discriminatory and invidious urban-directed amendments made in the Plantations Labour (Amendment) Bill 1973. Sir the Plantations Labour Act is sought to be applied now even to holdings of 5 hectares and above employing 15 persons and more. Originally in the Bill brought before the Joint Committee it was sought to be applied to holdings of 6.5 hectares and above. It would be realistic to make an amendment to the present Bill to raise the size of holdings from five hectares to 6.5 hectares. Sir we must bear in mind the economic viability of small plantations of 5 hectares and the financial capacity of the small planters to fulfil the obligations cast on them to provide housing and crèche facilities. Those small planters in some cases are unable to provide themselves with houses and medical care as good as those intended for their workers in the Bill. I am sure that good many small holdings will go into liquidation unable to bear the burden when the prices fall as in the case of tea today. I would emphatically say that Clause 13 is not only Draconian but discriminatory. And it is most harsh and killing to the farming community of India whose hands feed and clothe the people –poor and rich. Sir I strongly feel that the punishment with both compulsory fine and imprisonment is too serve for violation of a welfare legislation covered by the Act. For economic reasons and financial incapacity the debt- ridden employer particularly a small holder may be unable to discharge the obligation such as providing type-design houses creches medical facilities etc. In such cases there is no point in sending the landholder to jail and collecting a fine from him for every day of default. The relevant provisions in the Bill are made more stringent than the Factories Act under which in the case of a further offence the court is given the discretion to punish the defaulting employer. But in the proposed amendment the word used is ‘shall’ instead of ‘may’ which makes it mandatory on the court to impose imprisonment as well as fine. These provisions are too harsh and discriminatory particularly in view of the fact that the Bill seeks to bring in farms of five hectares which are in the nature of peasant holdings under the scope of the Act. Sir I would like to ask the Government of the people for the people and by the people in the name of the farmers of India why it wants to treat a farmer as a criminal and to be imprisoned for such an offence while it does not do so for a factory owner of a city? By making this comparison I do not mean that a provision should be made in the relevant Factories Act to make the sentence of imprisonment compulsory for similar offences. Let me make it clear that I am not speaking against the interests of the workers in the plantation. I am only speaking against the stringent and invidious measures which have been provided in the Bill affecting the rural employers and the invidious laws enacted for them.",
35: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir I welcome the Budget proposals for the year 1982-83 which are all comprehensive and which embrace most of the development plans that we have envisaged for the establishment of a socialistic society in this country. In spite of the taxation and the introduction of fresh duties we find that the Finance Minister has succeeded in disturbing only a microscopic section of the people of this country to extract sufficient funds for our schemes. The Finance Minister has also succeeded in finding funds for almost all the development plans of this country which will add to our good. While we discuss the general aspects of the Budget we will have to consider the activities of most of the sections that are now covered in the Budget. Even though the provisions are there I think Sir the expenditure on some of the activities envisaged in the Budget should be subjected to a thorough scrutiny. In this respect Sir I wish to bring to the notice of this House the special feature of the educational system of this country. Some of the members have mentioned something about the educational system of this country have remarked that the allocation of funds is not adequate and that the provision should be revised according to the needs of this country. As the hon’ble Member was speaking in Hindi I did not thoroughly understand what he meant but still Sir the educational system has created a sort of confusion in our country over the last fifteen years and every now and then we had been changing the schemes and plans for educating our children and various States have adopted different schemes which have actually created a feeling of disintegration among the people of this country. In some of the States they have switched on to the regional language as the medium of instruction and in some States they think that English should be retained as the medium of instruction. But the people believe that is the national language of our country. But Sir the time is not yet ripe for us to switch on to Hindi. So as and when we find it feasible we may switch on to our national language but till that time we will keep English as the medium of instruction in all educational institutions. Sir the other day the University Grants Commission submitted a report wherein they have mentioned that English should be the medium of instruction at least in the colleges. Sir it is my opinion that English should be retained in this country for years to come till we find that we could translate all the essential books books on science and technology etc. into Hindi which should be able to help us in educating our boys especially in the technical institutions through Hindi as the medium. Here Sir some of the Members have pointed out with regard to the introduction of different types of education in the same State or in various parts of this country. We find that a majority of the children of our country are educated in the basic system which brings out as far as I know second class citizens in this country who are to be governed by the boys who are sent to the public schools. Most of the children of the ‘haves’ are sent to the public schools and they are imparted expert training and when they come out they are definitely superior to those boys who undergo this basic system of education. If this basic education is considered to be the best for the development of our country in the socialistic way we will have somehow or other to find some better means of imparting education whereby they will be able to compete with the students who are now undergoing training in the public schools. Unless we do it we will be creating as I previously mentioned a second class of citizens in this country. I hope the authorities who are concerned with the planning of education in this country will review their schemes according to the suggestions that I have put forth now. In the game way Sir our country is mainly depending on our agriculture and industries for the development of our economy. But the agriculturists are an ignorant section of our people who do not find in spite of the development in that sector of our economy of high production a better income as the industrial section is having in this country. The industrial section is fast improving and their standard of living has gone high. At the same time in spite of the better production in the agricultural section the agrarian population has not come at par with the industrial section of this country. In the same way industrial labourers are organised. Most of them are given so many benefits and advantages according to the legislation that is passed for the betterment of industrial labourers of this country.",
36: "Madam Deputy Chairman I welcome this opportunity to make a few observations during the discussion on the Finance Bill. At this stage therefore it is better to use this opportunity to make a survey of the economic situation and find out what the present condition of the people is whether they are satisfied and if they are not satisfied what the reasons are. I feel this responsibility is greater today when the American aid is likely to be reduced and therefore we have got to stand more on our own legs. When the Plan was set forth there were three sources from which we hoped to get finance for the Plan namely our own resources from the revenues loans within the country through savings and thirdly foreign help. The latter we need not discuss here. If we study the accomplishments of the Plan and the resources that is has been possible to raise we cannot deny that our expectation have not been fulfilled and we have therefore to find out the reasons which have led to that situation. Here incidentally I would like to touch in a sentence or two the entire theme of the speech of Mr. Bhupesh Gupta. It is very easy to say this should be done or this could have been done from the opposition point of view but I would like to ask him a question and he can reply to it later in some other speech whether in Russia it would be possible for anybody not in the debate in the Parliament but even outside to utter a single sentence against the Government policy. In our democratic set-up we have allowed the people to criticise Government policies. Even as Congress people we are free to criticise the policies of the Government but the point is whether the doubts raised in the minds of the public by the people in the Opposition who show their loyalty to a different set-up would be conducive to create the enthusiasm that is necessary and the inspiration that is necessary to give their very best to fulfil the targets of the Plan. This Planned economy is really not a thing that will go successfully hand in hand with a democratic set-up unless some other things are there and they are the inculcation of a national spirit giving of proper national education to develop a national outlook. Unless these things are done as they are in other countries like England unless that type of spirit is created in the country by all the people of all types of views not being allowed to create differences and doubts in the minds of the people we cannot in a democratic set-up have the success which we want and we cannot fulfil our promises to the people. Without going further into that aspect which really came to my mind as a result of the long speech of Mr. Bhupesh Gupta I would like to make a few suggestions so that a proper attitude towards giving of one’s best to the Plan and to raise the national economy can be developed. I would like to make three or four points. Firstly we have to see that we take steps to check corruption at any level whether it is among the people in the public sector or among the officials. Then we have also to see that we give a proper type of education rouse a proper spirit of service. We must also check the trends for inflation and also lay stress on austerity so that the people feel that there is something at stake. I would not like to take much time of the House. The main problem in our country is the growing population and in spite of all the efforts that are made to raise the standard of living and raise production etc. the results are not as easily perceptible as they should have been. That is a separate problem by itself but in spite of that it is possible for the Government to show better results if the Government were to undertake immediately and see that some of the promises that are made the Acts that are passed and the Plans that are drawn up are properly implemented. I have been seeing this lacuna in the present position. Now the Government have started a new Ministry called the Coordination Ministry. It was very necessary because the plans of the different Ministries sometimes were likely to go contrary to each other’s aims. I do not want to go into details. For instance take the question of the promotion of export. A commodity may be exported but the price of that commodity in the country to the consumer may go on rising. Who is to see to that? Take tea for example; it had to be exported and nobody was there to see whether there was enough tea for consumption in the country and what was the price at which it was available to the consumer in the past.",
37: "Madam Deputy Chairman I rise to participate in this discussion not with a view to ventilate particular grievances or to secure concessions and relief in the taxation measures. I am one of those who believe that there is no justification for additional taxation unless the conditions laid down by the Taxation Enquiry Commission are complied with. It was a commission presided over by no less a person than Dr. John Mathai one of our illustrious Finance Ministers and it laid down that there was no justification for any additional taxation unless we complied with two or three conditions. One condition was that whatever tax was realised was being properly spend that there was no wastage or superfluous expenditure being incurred. The Commission had pointed out that out of every rupee that was being raised by the Government 60 paise were being spent on administration and about 20 paise were being spent on social services including education etc. and the balance for other things. Another was that whatever tax was being imposed should be realised before we brought out measures for fresh taxation. They also had suggested that there was sufficient room for economy in all the Ministries and Departments and effective steps should be taken forthwith to enforce the maximum possible economy in Government expenditure. Now we have before us this Audit Report for 1961-62 which was presented to the Lok Sabha on the 6th June and which came to my hands last night and I have not been able to study it I find that during the last five years we have imposed additional taxation and at the same time our revenue expenditure has gone up by about Rs.42 crores. So on the one hand we say that we are raising this money these taxes for the implementation of the Plan and for that reason every Chief Minister and Ministers go about saying that we want money for the implementation of the Plan. But what are the facts? We find that the money that has been raise is being used for administrative purposes. So it is not correct to say that. On the other hand it is not proper because you must know that no Plan however well-balanced and well thought out it may be can be implemented in a democratic set-up unless you can enthuse the people. We have been depending either on foreign aid or on indirect taxation or deficit financing and more than once I have pointed out that these measures will not help to enthuse the people and unless the people are enthused we will not have any successful results so far as planning is concerned. Now it is necessary it is time that we should take stock of the situation for we have had fourteen years of freedom and twelve years of democratic rule and of planned economy. What are the results? I am not one of those who minimize our achievements. We have had some achievements which are remarkable of which we can be proud. We have had three general elections and we can be proud of all this. But it is equally true that the expectations of the people remain mostly unfulfilled. They remain unrealised. What are the expectations of the people? They wanted an adequate supply of drinking water they wanted a little more wholesome food in their stomachs a little more cloth on their bodies a stronger roof over their heads freedom from the clutches of the corrupt officials and the grabing intermediaries and speedier justice. But what have we done? Have we been able to satisfy those expectations? I can say ‘No’. Even in the Third Five Year Plan we find that all the villages have not been provided with adequate supply of drinking water. And as for food only the other day the Finance Minister himself admitted in the other House that there was adulteration of foodstuffs all round. No only that a former Health Minister admitted in this House that it was difficult to get any article of food unadulterated. Then what is the use of talking about pure food articles and of other health facilities when the people are getting articles which are as good as poison? They are injurious to health. The other day the Finance Minister is reported to have said that the taxation proposals did not affect the common man because he needed only coarse cloth and ordinary food. During the last five years we have raised Rs. 424 crores more. Including the taxation measures this year the increase in revenue will be about 75 percent. Since 1956 we have raised additional taxation to the tune of 75 per cent and during the five years preceding this year the revenue expenditure has gone up by 85 per cent. I would like to know how much of this amount has gone towards developmental expenditure and towards social services.",
38: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir it was felt for a long time that the Limitation Act of 1908 which had certain amendments deserved reconsideration in all its aspects. With this object in view not only regarding this Act but regarding all the Acts that are at present in force after independence we appointed a Law Commission to revise all our laws. Sir the Law Commission went into this matter in very great detail and referring to certain basic principles that have been adopted and certain amendments that have been suggested by the Commission of Revision appointed in the United Kingdom they have gone through the whole enactment and suggested certain modification not only in sections but also in articles. I am very glad that the Law Ministry had brought forward the Bill on the basis as the Deputy Law Minister has pointed out that they have not followed the recommendations of the Law Commission but in general they have adopted the recommendations of the Law Commission in most of its aspects. Sir as this matter is to be entrusted to the Joint Committee of both the Houses it will have the benefit of the deliberations of all those members who are in the Select Committee and so generally speaking neither is this the occasion nor the practice to go into details but we can just suggest certain general matters so that the Select Committee may take them into consideration while deliberating in detail on the different provisions of this Bill. Sir in view of my experience as a lawyer I feel that the Law of limitation is a procedural matter except in certain sections where it confers definite rights on account of possession or certain other matters. We have to see that the matters that are disputed or are under litigation are disposed of in as short a period as possible. The trend everywhere is that the people should not be kept in suspense either before litigation or after litigation. So my humble suggestion to the Members of the Select Committee will be to see that the course of litigation is as much circumscribed as much reduced as is possible in consonance with the basic principle of fairness justice and equity. To substantiate what I am submitting I would give an example and the members of the Select Committee will go into details of the Law Commission Report. So far as matters relating to trustees to whom the property has been entrusted or in case of disability as minors or insane persons and similar cases are concerned of course we will have to take all necessary precautions and if necessary we can extend the time so that these persons who are suffering under any disability should not in the long run suffer on account of the provisions of the Limitation Act. That is one of the fundamental things which I hope the Select Committee will bear in mind. Apart from these two considerations the other consideration that I will place before the Select Committee is relating to property whether it is on the basis of contract or otherwise. I am glad that they are trying to very much simplify things by including definite categories into a simple form. Similarly by including petitions in applications they are trying to cover up a bigger scope and all these details I need not go into at this stage but I would request that they get the time reduced rather than extend it. For instance in money matters instead of 3 years I would be happy if it is a case of one year. In matters of land of course those days when there were big zamindars big talukdars or jagirdars were different. Now the whole trend has changed. If at all a litigation is confined to commercial matters where everybody is alert. The circumstances do demand and f there is anything wrong if somebody wants to claim something from the other party it is no use sleeping over it. So the period of limitation should be considered in all these matters from this angle that so far as possible let the litigation be introduced or let the suit be filed as early as possible and accordingly the disposal could also be done. So I would request the Select Committee to take the changed circumstances of the country into consideration and come to the conclusion to simplify matters and let us reduce it so that the limitation as far as possible may be reduced. We know that protracted disputed go on as I have just pointed out which give rise to different interpretations as is evident from the Law Commission report and the different High Courts have taken different views on certain matters. That creates confusion that creates difficulties. Unless either in the old decisions there is a clear decision of the privy council or at present there is clear decision of the Supreme Court difficulties would arise. So I would suggest that all these cases should be taken into consideration.",
39: "In presenting this Report my first duty would be to thank the Dhebar Commission for preparing this valuable document. The commission have gone deep into the various aspects of this problems and have produced an important and valuable document. The commission had to tour a lot and they had to put in very hard work. I should like to convey my thanks and congratulations to the Chairman of the Commission Shri Dhebar and also to his other colleagues for this useful contribution. As the House is aware the problem of the Scheduled Tribes has been constantly engaging the attention of the Government since the Constitution was framed and adopted. Still the Government were not satisfied with the actual progress made. It was in that context that the Government appointed two Committees before the Dhebar Commission was appointed. The first was the Elwin Committee which specially dealt with the problem of the tribal blocks. The Second Committee was appointed on the suggestion of the estimates committee to study the problem of the backward communities specially. On top of that in pursuance of Article 339 of the Constitution the Government appointed the Dhebar Commission and now it is for the House to give its opinion on the recommendations made by the Commission. Our desire is that as soon as the Parliament – this House as well as the other House – has discussed this Report and expressed its views we will go ahead with the recommendations made and we will certainly like that they are implemented as early as possible. I do not want to enter into generalities but it just be said that our country is vast and our problems are also immense. Generally we are a very poor country and it is true that during the British days we did not actually realise what poverty meant. People suffered without must protest but now when the country is trying to go ahead with economic development it is but natural that every section of our community should like to progress simultaneously. I think if we are frank we should admit that there are certain weaker sections of our community in the country who have not made as much advance and progress as others have done. It has therefore become very important that we should lay special emphasis on the development of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled tribes. It is necessary therefore that we should carefully consider the various recommendations made and see what we can do to achieve a certain target within a prescribed period. The Scheduled Tribes have been living in isolated places far-off places not connected with roads. They do not have any amenities of life neither medical aid nor even proper educational facilities. We have to bring them out of that situation and we must try to integrate those people with other sections of our countrymen. It is far from my mind to suggest that we should impose anything on them whether our customs or our culture though the culture is more or less common throughout the country but every community has its own conventions and customs. Therefore when I say that there should be complete integration I do not mean to suggest that there should be imposition of anything on the tribal communities as such. Still it is essential that integration will only be possible if their standards are raised if they are more or less brought to the same level where we or the other people are who are not so isolated. So we have to bring these people to that level and we can do that not by implementing certain schemes only but by bringing about a radical change in our outlook and approach. There may be different communities and different religions in our country but India had its own unique tradition in the past which we have to carry on and maintain even now. In fact our philosophic base has been unity in diversity and in it is our good fortune that when we are free when we have become independent various communities and religions exist in our country and it should be our effort to bring about complete unity and solidarity amongst ourselves even if our religions are different or we differ in our customs rights etc. So I think that it is a challenge to all of us and I have no doubt that we will be able to meet this challenge. I do not want to take more time of the House. As I said in the beginning I do not want to enter into generalities. So far as the recommendations of the Commission are concerned they can broadly be divided into two categories. There are recommendations which are to be dealt with or which directly concern the Home Ministry and some other Ministries of the Government of India. There are other recommendations which mainly concern the State Governments. In fact it is the State Governments which have really to execute and implement the programmes.",
40: "It was suggested by the Commission that there should be a separate department for the Scheduled Tribes. This matter was considered in the Conference but it was generally felt that if the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes are separated to be dealt with by different Departments there will be a good deal of duplication of work because two sets of officers will have to traverse the same area and more or less consider the same problems. It was therefore the unanimous opinion of the Conference of State Ministers that one Department should deal with the problems of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and it was also agreed that there should be a separate directorate for the same. If there is a separate Directorate then it can concentrate on problems concerning the Scheduled Tribes. It was also suggested that this Directorate which will have to be set up in all the States and especially in States where the population of the Scheduled Tribes exceeds one million should also look after the work relating to the de-notified and the nomadic tribes in addition to as I said the work relating to the Scheduled Tribes. The Conference was in favour of having Tribes Advisory Councils to advise on the protection and development of the Scheduled Tribes in all the States and Union Territories whether they have Scheduled Areas or not. The House I am sure is aware that there are Scheduled Areas and non- Scheduled Areas. Even in non- Schedule Areas a large number of Scheduled Tribes live but for the special programmes we have decided to concentrate on the Scheduled Areas first. I shall come to that point later on but I am merely mentioning that the Scheduled Tribes live both in Scheduled Areas and in non-Scheduled Areas. It was decided that wherever at present there is a combined reservation in the services for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes separate percentages of reservation should be fixed by the State Governments and it was agreed that the State Governments would instruct all local authorities like municipalities panchayats samities zila parishads etc. to follow the policies laid down by them in regard to the representation of all Scheduled Tribes in the services. It was decided to have a small committee of officials from the Tribal Welfare Department and the different Departments at the State level to ensure co-ordination. The Conference also agreed that there should be a section under the Chief Secretary for evaluation of the tribal welfare programme. If all these and other decisions taken at the Conference are implemented with speed as it is hoped they will be there will be considerable improvement of the conditions which exist at present. I also want to mention Madam that we were told in the Conference that this work was going to be entrusted to the zila parishads and panchayats and some of the schemes which have to be implemented in the rural areas will be executed by the panchayats and the zila parishads. Well I welcome this suggestion but I only wanted to caution the district authorities and the State Governments not to leave everything to the zila parishads and panchayats and have no supervision and watch over their work. My fear is that because this will be a new work for them they may not be able to bestow enough attention to the problems or the schemes concerning the Scheduled Tribes. They will have many other things to do. So it would be necessary that the district authorities should keep constant watch and they should function as the friend and guide of the panchayats and the zila parishads. Madam there are two major schemes in respect of the the Scheduled tribes in the Central sector of the programme which are controlled by the Ministry of Home Affairs and on which the entire expenditure is borne by the Government of India. These are the scheme of tribal Development Blocks and the scheme relationg to promotion of co-operation among the Scheduled tribes particularly in the form of forest labourers cooperative societies and labour contract societies. The Ministry of Home Affairs appointed a special working group on cooperation about a year ago and its report is expected shortly. That group will make detailed recommendations regarding the organization and structure of the society and other matters pertaining to the cooperative movement in areas predominantly inhabited by the Scheduled tribes. We hope that on the basis of the working group recommendations it will be possible to energise and expand the cooperative movement in Tribal areas and the cooperatives will become the effective instruments for promoting the economic development of those areas. The other programme which is the major one and in which a great deal of interest is being evinced by the tribals themselves is the programme of Tribal Development Blocks. The Commission have recommended that all tribal areas whether they are Scheduled Areas or not with a concentration of tribal population exceeding 50 per cent should be brought under the Tribal Blocks.",
41: "Sir this Bill was introduced in the House by the then Labour Minister Shri K.V. Raghunatha Reddy. I was also present at that time in the House. After a period of nine long years this Bill has now come from the cold-storage. It shows how powerful the plantation lobby in the country is. Even though after so much of time this Bill has now been brought I support this Bill. In the name of a more comprehensive measure I do not agree that this Bill should be postponed or that it should be again referred to a joint Committee. Some such proposal was there. I do not agree to that. Though it is not adequate and some improvement from the point of view of workers is needed I do not agree that we should postpone passing it. For example it has been suggested that the acreage limit should be brought down to five hectares to cover more plantations. In the south especially in Kerala Karnataka and other southern states many plantations are not covered by this Bill. I would request the Minister to carefully examine this thing. In North India and some other places tea plantation is on a large scale. But in the case of rubber cardamom and coffee it is five hectares. This is on the high side. I request the hon. Minister to reduce the acreage limit to 2-1/2 hectares for coffee and rubber and cardamom. Our friend was talking about socialism socialist society democratic socialism and so many other things. I earnestly request him to consider my suggestion and that is whether the Government is prepared to nationalise the tea industry. Sir some eight years ago in the Kerala Assembly all the parties including Congress Party unanimously recommended to the Central Government for the takeover of the tea industry. In Kerala tea plantation is owned by British monopolies. Even in the Assam Assembly all the parties unanimously passed a Resolution suggesting takeover of this industry. Are you prepared to take over this industry especially this tea industry? I pose this question to the Central Government. Sir this tea industry is owned by foreign monopolies and they are exploiting the workers. The situation in the tea industry to deteriorating. Are you prepared to nationalise it when you talk of socialism? Unless this is nationalised you cannot meet the demands of the workers. Sir how unfortunate for this country predominantly agricultural that the meaning of plantation in this Bill has been stretched to include coconut gardens apple pineapple cashewnut and banana plantation farms. I am glad that wisdom has dawned on the Government not to accept these recommendations of the Committee. If I were an anarchist or a member who wished ill of this Government I would have pleaded with the Government to stretch the meaning of plantations to cover all agricultural lands in the country and attract the provisions of this Bill. Then we could have seen the beginning of convulsions and revolutions in this country as the debt-ridden farmers being unable to fulfil the provisions of this Bill would have started filling up jails for violations of its provisions. Sir I would take this opportunity to appeal to the Prime Minister to treat agriculture as an industry and treat agriculturists like the urban citizens and treat the farm-holdings in the same way as they treat the factories and industries. The Government should start finding out the invidious and discriminatory law as passed in the country since independence adversely affecting the farming community and review those laws if they want to ensure intergrated development of the country. Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir you know the undivided Congress the Indian National Congress fought for plantation labour and also for the rights and privileges of the peasantry. It was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Mahatma Gandhi in the Chauri-Chaura Movement who brought the peasantry to the forefront to the leadership of the Indian National Congress. As successors of those great leaders in that organisations it is high time the Congress did their best for the plantation labour as well as the unorganized peasantry in that area. Even in Mexica in Algeria in Russia or in Cuba or in other countries it was the labour the plantation labour who took the revolution to its final goal. Here in this country we do not want to see another blood bath we do not want to see that thy take up arms against Government or against employers. As people’s representatives and as Government of the people we must do our best to solve their problems whatever their grievances are whatever their difficulties are instead of allowing anybody to take advantage of their poverty and their difficulties. I know what goes on with plantation labour. I can give instances of different plantations. I come from West Bengal where tea plantation is a very big factor and I know how plantation labour are still being exploited. Housing facility near the plantations is a must for them under the Act.",
42: "Sir the Resolution itself is very badly drafted but it draws attention to one of the most pressing problems of this country. Full employment is an objective of every kind of economy in this world whether capitalist socialist communist or mixed economy. Therefore it is also one of our objectives. But then we are not able to find out whether we are proceeding on the road of greater employment or greater unemployment. I am afraid that thinking on this matter is today so confused and contradictory that unless we can have a rational comprehension of the whole problem we are not likely to make any headway. Therefore I want to define how we should approach the problem. First of all this is not a single problem but two different and distinct problems. We should not confuse total unemployment with partial employment or under-employment. These are two different things that have to be dealt with in entirely different fashions but unfortunately when we speak of 15 or 19 million unemployed nobody know how many of these are really totally unemployed and how many are suffering from seasonal or partial unemployment. Total unemployment is an urban phenomenon. It is only in cities and towns you have people who have to work whatsoever. In the rural areas it is always a case of partial unemployment or seasonal unemployment. Therefore the first thing to be done in order to solve this is we must fine out we must devise a machinery to ascertain how many are totally unemployed and how many are under-employed. So I do suggest that every municipality in this country should maintain a register of the unemployed. Of course we have now the Labour Exchanges. Unfortunately they are not to be found everywhere and all unemployed do not register themselves there. Therefore I suggested that in every municipality there should be an unemployment register and propaganda should be done among the unemployed that they should first register themselves in the municipal register. Similarly I would suggest that in every village panchayat there should be a register where people will register themselves for under-employment because during the harvest season there is actually shortage of labour in the villages rather than the reverse. Therefore there would have to be different kinds of registers to show in what seasons you want to give employment and to devise suitable employment. Then secondly we have to realize that so far as total unemployment is concerned the only way is to develop industries and social services. The word ‘employment’ is also used very loosely. In the Ambar Charkha if a man gets 40 or 60 paise it is called employment. That will not do. We must defined employment as giving him work which will give him living wages. Any work which does not give living wages should not be called employment. If we have to give living wages the only way of doing it for the totally unemployed is to develop our industries and expand our social services. So far as social services are concerned there is enormous scope for expansion. Why should you not in this country have one teacher for every 20 children? Why should we have one teacher for 40 children? Immediately we can increase the strength of teachers by lakhs. But the real difficulty is we have to pay them and therefore we are now caught in a dilemma. Without increase of wealth we cannot increase the social services. Without increasing the social services we cannot give sufficient and adequate employment for the totally employed in the towns. Therefore the development of industries is essential. Without the development of industries and social services the problem of total unemployment cannot be solved. Therefore it is no use blaming the Planning Commission or anybody. Of course some kind of temporary employment can be devised by such ways as asking the man to go and dig the high level and make it low level and give them some temporary wages but that will be only waste of scarce resources and we shall not be solving the problem of unemployment. Therefore a faster development of industry and out of the surplus proceeds of industry a quicker development of the social services is the only possible solution for total unemployment. For partial employment or under-employment in the villages it has to be solved in a different way. Intensification of agriculture is bound to increase employment. For instance wherever there is single crop if we can introduce double crop the total amount of labour required will be doubled. Therefore conversion of single crop lands into double croplands and providing irrigation and other facilities for them is one of the certain methods of solving this under-employment. Again many traditional services such as the annual repair of irrigation tanks canals etc. have lapsed. We must resume them. I am sure they will give at least an average of 20 under-employed workers in the villages further worsening the unemployment problem in the country.",
43: "Mr. Vice Chairman Sir at the outset I must express my thanks to hon. Members on both sides of the House who have participated in the discussion on the Tenth Five-Year Plan document. Honourable Members will very kindly appreciate that within the short time at my disposal it will not be possible for me to clarify all the points which they have raised during the course of the discussion. I am going to confine my remarks to certain important aspects of the discussion though I have taken note of almost all the points which hon. Members made during the course of the discussion. At the outset I must also say that one of the hon. Members was pleased to ask what is the purpose of having this kind of a discussion one and a half years or almost two years after the Plan has started? I do not know whether hon. Members do recollect that my predecessor Mr. Tiwari had circulated a note to all the members of this House particularly about the Tenth Plan framework and he expected that the hon. Members will able to send their remarks to the Minister and also to the Planning Commission so that before the draft document of the Tenth Plan is prepared and finalised their views could be taken into account. How many members sent this kind of information is a mater which I will have to enquire into but that exercise was gone into and now the Plan was finalised in February 2001 and thereafter we have taken the earliest possible opportunity to see that the Plan is discussed in both the Houses. Sir I am aware of the fact that the international situation and also the internal situation in which this Tenth Five-Year Plan has been finalise will definitely have some kind of an impact on the Plan document as it was prepared and how we will be succeeding in trying to avoid the adverse effects it might have on the achievement of the physical targets that we have set for ourselves at the end of the Tenth Five-Year Plan. Sir there are three points which we mentioned by all the hon. Members. The first was that the Plan was prepared with 1990-00 as the base year and thereafter there has been a price rise of a considerable order. Sir the first thing which I would like to clarify is about the inflationary trend which has set in. One of the hon. Members Shri Sankar Ghose – a very experienced member of this House who had also been in the Planning Commission and knows the intricacies of how the things are being worked out – has been pleased to state here that the rate of inflation is very high and added to that the balance of payments position is going to be very bad. Compared with the percentage that we have worked out for the Tenth Plan as a whole for imports for the first year the import bill has risen very high. Then how is this assumption going to be correct? That is the point – and a very valid point – which he raised during the course of the discussion. Sir he also mentioned about the hon. Finance Minister making his speech at Kanpur wherein he seems to have made a reference that a little inflationary trend is a kind of a stimulant to the economy. Sir the inflationary trends we cannot view in isolation. Hon. Shri Sankar Ghose will definitely agree with us that there are two factors which will have to be taken into account. The first factor is the international situation which is now obtaining. Secondly whether we like it or not we have to import the oil products. If they are to be imported can we take a serious view of the situation? That is a thing which I am sure most of the hon. Members there will be able to appreciate. The second aspect is: Why is it that we have such a high import bill in 2000-01. When the Plan itself commenced and when we were talking in terms of 9 per cent. immediately in the very first year it jumped. I am sure that most of the hon. Members are aware of the fact that it is on account of the kind of legacy that this Government got. I would not like to dilate on that issue. But the fact of the matter is that the agricultural production had gone down. Even in the industrial sector there was a decline of 1.4 per cent. The coal production had considerably gone down in terms of production and the electricity generation was at the lowest. If we had to make a beginning which in fact is within the control of the Government of India with these infrastructural facilities which will have to be provide both in the agricultural sector and the industrial sector concerted efforts will have to be made.",
44: "Mr. Vice-Chairman the Minister of Railways has given us some impressive figures regarding route mileage the number of passenger trains that run everyday the number of goods trains that run every day the number of millions of passengers who travel by train. He has tried to compare them. In view of the vastness of the country the large number of passenger trains being run the large number of goods trains being run and the big route mileage he has tried to show that the number of accidents that have occurred is not quite alarming. I do not know what his idea was when he tried to compare the number of accidents against this background. Committees have been appointed when serious accidents took place to find out why such and such accident took place. The Shah Nawaz Committee which was appointed in 1956 gave a very voluminous report. Therein they had stated the causes of accidents that occurred during the period before and they had also suggested some preventive measures. The Government have again appointed another Committee headed by Dr. Kunzru. It is more than eight months or so. I do not know why an interim report has not been submitted by this committee. It would have been better at least for discussion on such an important subject like this if that Committee had submitted an interim report. We could have offered more constructive suggestions. Unfortunately the Committees that are appointed take their own time to submit their reports. Maybe the Government is partly responsible for they may not be co-operating with the Committee in giving all the material that is necessary for the Committee to come to some sort of conclusions and give their findings on such an important question. Time and again we have discussed this question of accidents and I was really pained to see how the Minister tried to minimize the seriousness of the railway accidents. He also quoted in the other House the figures the number of accidents that are taking place in other countries particularly America and England. The conditions that are obtaining in these countries and that are obtaining in India are totally different. There many of the accidents take place not because of follies not because of the limitations under which those railways work but mostly because of the environment that there has been in those countries. So he did not mention the figures here but took refuge under the guise that our railways work much better than the railways work in other countries and that the rate of accidents in India is much lower than the rate of accidents in America or England. Sir by having this discussion the Railway Board and the Railway Ministry should be able to learn some lessons and if they are prepared to implement the salient suggestions that will be made by the Members then many of these discussions will not take place and many of the accidents that take place these days will not occur. It has now become almost an everyday affair. After the statement was made by the hon. Minister in this House and the other House another accident had occurred to a De-luxe train. It is therefore incumbent and imperative on the part of the Railway Ministry to see whether they could avoid these accidents. Many of the accidents that have occurred have occurred not because they are accidents but because of the wrong things done by the Railway Ministry. When a train leaves the station care is not taken to see whether it has a defective engine defective locomotive whether proper check was made of it whether the bogies that are attached to the train are properly checked up whether the screws and bolts that are there are properly placed in their proper places and so on. These are all things which if properly inspected will show whether the train is fit for travelor not and if these things are properly adhered to many of the accidents will not occur. A Member in the other House has reported a statement from ‘The Statesman’ of Calcutta that the locoshed people asked the driver of a particular train to somehow manage even though he complained that he could not take the train. He tried to manage. When the train arrived very late he was said to have been man handled by the crowd for the late arrival of the train and he is reported to have stated to the correspondent that inspite of the protest that he made he was asked to take that locomotive which was very defective. Last year similar accidents occurred for instance the Ranchi accident. It is also reported that the engine driver protested when he was asked to take the train because the engine was defective. But in spite of his protests he was forced to take that engine and an accident occurred. I am glad that an Enquiry Commission has been appointed to go into the cause of the accident.",
45: "Madam Deputy Chairman from the speeches which the hon. Minister for Planning made in this house and in the other House and from a perusal of the note which has been circulated to us regarding the progress that has been made in the Third Five Year Plan and the various statements of the Government and the Planning Commission I have a feeling that the Government of India is trying to assuage the feeling of dissatisfaction in the country through promises of bright future promises of bettor efforts and general promise that everything is going to turn out all right and that there need not be any fear or anxiety in the country. Madam while saying this I realize that the country has made certain progress in the development of our economy during the last decade. Industrial production has increased agricultural production has increased the productive capacity has been built up and we have also got employment opportunities being created. Above all we have gained valuable experience in the development of our economy especially in planning and these are all to the credit side of the Plan. Unfortunately Madam the price that we have paid for this progress is rather heavy. The imbalance that we have created are likely to go out of control unless definite steps are taken to see that the imbalances are corrected at the earliest opportunity. The problem of the distribution of income that is generated as a result of the development efforts in the country is a perennial question and comes up again and again in one form or the other before this House and though I realize that no definite opinion is possible unless we have got some authoritative data and analysis on the subject there is clear indication of the fact that if not economic wealth at least economic power is being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands it will not be possible for us to develop in the manner in which we like whatever may be our regulatory and control apparatus whatever may be our policy whatever may be the objectives that we place before the country. Similarly the imbalance between the rural and the urban sector is also increasing. I do not know whether is the rural areas some income has been pumped in as a result of our planned development. It is possible that the well-to-do peasants the richer peasants might have benefited as a result of our economic development but as far as the rural area as a whole is concerned the disparity and imbalance is definitely growing and that is also a matter of concern. The very fact that urbanisation takes place at such a rapid rate in our country is visible proof that the imbalance has been growing with the result that neither the urban areas nor the rural areas are today in a position to live the life that they were living before our planned developmental efforts started. Now there is over-congestion in the urban areas; the civic amenities are all on the point of breaking down and they continuously break down with the slightest accident here or there. The slums are increasing at a rapid rate and unemployment is increasing. Whatever may be the figures regarding crimes etc. that may be published by the Government there is a definite impression in the country that the crime situation is also deteriorating. That is because of the congestion in the urban areas. Because of the difficulties due to lack of resources they are unable to deal with the problems that arise as a result of this over-congestion and the problem of law and order becomes more acute as a result of this urbanization. Thirdly the question of unemployment has also taken a rather serious turn and when the Government spokesman addresses homilies to others regarding the agitation against high prices and higher taxes they completely forget that year by year one earner has to support more and more people andwe have got the authority of no less a person than the Planning Minister himself to say that the real income of the earner at least in the lower income groups has not risen and in spite of that that earner has to support a larger and larger number of dependants. There is so much dissatisfaction in the country that people are clamouring against rising prices and rising taxes. The Planning Minister has given us a frank picture regarding what has happened in the first year of the Third Plan Period and we are grateful to him for this frank picture. The figures that he has cited have given us a clear idea of what is happening to our economy at the present moment. But he has tried to strike a note of optimism. He has tried to explain the reasons that are responsible for this state of affairs and he has also indicated that the Planning Commission is conscious of all these drawbacks.",
46: "The crux of the whole matter therefore is the inability on the part of the Government to manipulate the prices in a manner whereby it may be possible to achieve crop planning in order to achieve the desired results. As long as the price structure is allowed to move in the manner in which it is moving today whatever may be the policy of the Government howsoever much credit they may pump into the agricultural sector whatever the amenities they may give to the agriculturists it will not be possible for us to achieve the targets in the manner in which we want to achieve. I would have been satisfied if as a result of this increased agricultural production the farmer was better off. But we find that whenever there is increased production in response to higher prices the markets slump down so heavily that ultimately the farmer stands to lose instead of to gain. Therefore the farmer loses both ways and the country also loses. The farmer puts in more money more resources in the production of crops for which he expects higher returns and he loses all the money because the prices fall down rather precipitously and the country is also losing because there is a very uneven development of agriculture. Therefore the crux of the whole problem is not just to hold the price-line or just to see that black-marketing is avoided. That is only one part of the job a very important part of the price policy and that has got to be kept in mind. I am not against it; in fact I am all for it and I blame the Government for not being able to do it so far but this is another aspect of the price policy to which the Planning Commission it seems to me has not applied its mind properly so far namely the use of price policy as an instrument of crop planning and as long as that particular tool is not utilized for this objective it will not be possible for us to have a planned development of our economy. Then there is the question of incentives. We are now told every time that unless incentives are given it will not be possible for us to develop our economy. We are hearing daily about our export promotion. Now the problem of incentives also has to be viewed in terms of the objective of the development of a socialist economy in our country and not just from the point of view of earning more and more foreign balances. I am not in any way belittling the problem of foreign balances but ultimately the problem of foreign balances has significance and meaning only in terms of the objectives that the Third Plan has set before it. Therefore when we are talking of incentives in order to earn more foreign balances we have also to think of incentives in terms of achieving the objectives that we have got in mind. I was therefore disappointed to read the speech of the Planning Minister as he said as the Planning Minister at the Indian Labour Conference in which he seems to have indicated a new approach to the problem of wages. His approach has passed through three stages. In the first stage just after the general election the Planning Minister came out with a statement that he was thoroughly dissatisfied with the way in which the wage structure had developed and that he meant to do something about it. He categorically stated that the real wages had not increased because of intransigence of the management and he further stated that he wanted to do something about it. Then there came about a discussion as to what could be done and all the industrialists themselves and the financial newspapers in this country came out with the theory that wages could be increased only if productivity is increased and therefore wages should be linked with productivity. That was the second stage viz. increase productivity and wages will be increased. That was the slogan or that was the principle which was accepted even by the industrialists. But what do we find in the speech of the Planning Minister to the Indian Labour Conference? There he says that even if productivity increases the first charge will be in respect of projects which are meant for further employment or certain of more employment opportunities. That means even if productivity increases it is not that the workers will immediately benefit in terms of higher wages so that it may be possible for them to improve their standard of living a little bit. Even if productivity rises. The fruits of productivity will go to schemes for creating further employment opportunities in the country. How long are the workers to wait and what exactly will be the stage at which it can be stated that enough employment opportunities have been created and therefore the stage has come for increased wages?",
47: "Madam you are aware that when this life business was nationalised in the year 1956 great expectations and great hopes were entertained by all Members of Parliament. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons relating to that measure the Finance Minister stated that nationalisation was necessary and imperative to achieve the broad objectives of increasing insurance business to take it to larger areas including the rural areas and to give greater returns to policy-holder. We have to see after these few years of the working of this organisation how far we have achieved these great objectives. In the past also we may remember that many criticisms have been made in regard to the working of this organisation. Even the Estimates Committee has gone into this question and examined in detail the various aspects of the working of this organisation. That committee has made certain recommendations. Those recommendations are very important and I will advert to them shortly. Before I deal with them I wish to make one point clear. In spite of the various criticisms and in spite of the various comments made in the House in the Press and also through various organisations the working of this organisation has not been improved very much. The Report which we are discussing today relates to the year 1966. Obviously it is a very old document and a discussion on this Report at this hour perhaps is too late. Nevertheless a discussion is important if we keep in view some of the fundamental problems that are facing this organisation. This Report was submitted in November 1961 that is to say some nine months after the period of the working of this organisation. I do not know why there should be such inordinated delay in submitting reports. The Report Madam deals with various aspects. It does not bring out many things which ought to be properly brought out in a report of this kind. And while reading this Report I was not able to make out the working of this organisation and to get a proper understanding of it. For that purpose I have to depend upon other reports and other opinions expressed by various organisation in this country and thereby I have to gather information. That is why I have to suggest that the Report should be comprehensive. I would refer to some of the important problems confronting this organisation. The most important among them in my opinion is the organisational set up. You remember when this matter came up for discussion in both Houses of Parliament at the time of the nationalisation of this life business suggestions were made by certain members. I was participation in the other house in the debate then and I suggested that one corporation would not be better and it is desirable to have more than one organisation to have more than one corporation. I suggested this and a good many Members of my Party made this suggestion because they thought that there should be some sort of comparative standards to measure the efficiency and performance of this organisation. Without such comparative standards to measure the efficiency and the work of this organisation it would be difficult to judge either the efficiency of the organisation of the improvement or progress made by the organisation. Therefore we suggested that there should be more than one corporation perhaps there should be 3 or 4. Now after the experience gained the Estimates Committee has come to this conculsion that this is a huge monolithic organisation whose task has been increasing all the time and that it has not been possible for this organisation to fulfil all the expectations and all the tasks and all the requirements that are expected to be fulfilled by this organisation. And so the Estimates Committee has suggested a radical change a revolutionary departure with regard to the organisational set-up. They have advisedly pointed out two alternatives. The first alternative is to set up more than one corporation so that there may be division of work and division of areas. There may also be healthy competition between the corporations so that the country and the people may know which corporation is doing better and which is not doing better. The other alternative they have suggested is that there should be one organisation with a federal structure with semi-zonal units functioning. Therefore I also submit that with this monolithic structure it would be difficult for the organisation to carry out its functions more efficiently and in a direction which is healthy and which is progressive. In the first instance therefore I would suggest that the Ministry should immediately take steps to see that the whole organisational set –up is revised and reorganised so that there may be better efficiency and understanding maintained into the working of this great institution. The organisation as it is constituted reveals certain inherent defects. The main office is managed by a large number of officials.",
48: "Mr. Vice-Chairman the Delhi Corporation and the Congress Party and also the other political parties in the Corporation in the last corporation as well as in the present one appointed one Committee from the Corporation consisting of all the parties which was to consider and decided what amendments they wanted in the Municipal Corporation Act. In the present Corporation also a similar committee is there which has been examining the desirability of introducing new legislation to amend and improve the functioning of the present Corporation. That Committee is deciding and considering this issue and its proposals and suggestions will be sent to the Home ministry very shortly. The Home Ministry is also very anxious that various amendments should be brought forward and that the Act should be improved so as to make the Corporation very effective and efficient. The Home Ministry have asked for suggestions and proposals form this Committee and the Committee is also anxious about it. That being the case I think that this Bill may be postponed pending the consideration of all the suggestions which will come not only form this Committee but from the Home Ministry. The Home Ministry themselves have quite a few proposals in view to introduce so as to take care of the various lacunae that are there. Also this Committee of the Corporation and the Congress Party in Delhi as well as other political parties in Delhi are anxious to make their suggestions. All those suggestions from all the parties and this Corporation Committee have to be examined in detail by the Home Ministry as well as the other departments concerned. And there could be several suggestions by the Ministry itself. So when all those proposals come then I think the whole Bill should be taken up and one complete comprehensive Bill should be introduced to take care of allthe difficulties shortcomings and defects thatthere are in the Municipal Corporation Act. I may only briefly touch some of the difficulties that we have been facing for a very long time. I think the Ministry is very particular that the power shouldbe kept in the hands of the executive. All the Chairmen are also absolutely helpless so much so that this is a common talk among the members in the Corporation among the members in the Congress Party who have to run some of the show of the Corporation. The Chairman cannot even call for a file concerning the particular department of which he is the Chairman whether it is the Water and Sewage Board or the Transport Authority or the Medical Committee or the Health Committee or the Education Committee. None of these elected Chairman who are there have the power or the authority to call for a file and examine the papers. A conversation was going on among the members concerning this problem as to how to handle the affairs of their departments if they could not look at a file or examine it. One suggestion made was that the Mayor might call for the file and the Chairman might go to his office andlook at the file and then the Mayor might return the file. I think it is a very ridiculous situation where you have all the 80 people sitting in that Corporation hall with no powers at all. When the Bill was passed and the Corporation was established I am very sorry to say it was a very nice toy given to the people of Delhi with which they might strike their heads over which they might quarrel and fight and deteriorate the whole business. It is because they have nothing to do they have no powers. Then as our experience goes to show the machinery of the Government is generally not so cooperative. The Government are not at all interested in seeing that the Corporation’s function should be successful or efficient or that the Corporation should succeed. By and Large and very unfortunately they rarely want that this whole show should be going well. They just as well want to enjoy the failures of the Corporation and laugh over them and even propagate the failures everywhere in public and in private here and there. It is very discouraging very bad for the morale of the administration and the public at large. Unfortunately it is like that. It is a fact to reckon with. It is a situation to be faced. Resolutions have been passed by the Corporation for so many years for three years four years andso on. But I think half of the resolutions have not been implemented. Provision has been made in the budgets for various things but the money has not been used. The machinery of the Corporation is not bothered about it or is not serious enough or concerned about implementing the resolutions passed by the Government. The resolutions passed by the Corporation have certainly to be taken very seriously and implemented faithfully. There is no faithful implementation. The elected members can do nothing about this matter.",
49: "The credit movement in this country started in 1904 and it had its own difficulties since the last several decades. The main problem regarding co-operative credit has been that it has been untimely and inadequate. In 1904 the Co-operative Societies Act was passed which was later amended in 1914. Then there were certain committees appointed and they reported about the weaknesses of the credit movement in the country. In 1919 this subject of co-operation was transferred to the States after which several States passes Co-operative Acts of their own. Thereafter in 1929 the Royal Commission made certain enquiries about co-operation and the credit movement and made certain recommendations. And till 1950 or 1951 there was very little improvement in the field of co-operation. In 1951 the Reserve Bank of India appointed the Rural Credit Survey Committee which brought out its Report in 1954. That Committee came to the conclusion that only 3 per cent of the credit required by the agriculturists in the country was being met by the co-operatives and it made certain suggestions. It suggested that there should be an integrated credit structure in the country and said that there should be share participation by the Government in the co-operative societies. It suggested that the Government should take shares in the co-operative societies so that the co-operative movement can get strength through Government participation. The second recommendation made by the Rural Credit Survey Committee was that there should be linking of credit with marketing processing consumers storage and all other fields of activity so that credit will develop marketing consumption processing etc. Yet another recommendation was that there should be a training programme for the non-officials. The fourth recommendation and the most salient one was that there should be a three-tier structure of credit; there should be co-operative societies at the lower level; then there should be district banks and then the apex banks and that all the three should be interlinked. These recommendations were accepted by the Government of India. This Report also recommended that in order to implement these suggestions there should be a National Co-operative Development and warehousing Board. The Government of India have accepted these suggestions in 1956. According to that Act there came into being a Warehousing Board which took care of the warehouses in the country and also the National Development Board which took care of the development of the co-operatives. It was first thought that the two Boards should be worked out under two different Acts but as both the subjects were administratively under one Ministry at that time namely the Ministry of Food and Agriculture it was thought proper at that stage that the same Act should administer the National Development Board and the Warehousing Corporation. Thereafter a separate Department of Co-operation was created and attached to the Ministry of Community Development now called the Ministry of Community Development Panchayati Raj and Co-operation. And it was decided by the Government in 1960 that there should be two separate Acts one for Co-operative Development Board and the other for Warehousing. In one of the papers submitted by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture on the basis of which the Presidential Order to create the Department of Co-operation was passed it was suggested that these two bodies should be administered separately and that is why we have now come before Parliament with this National Co-operative Development Corporation Bill. The other bill relating to the Warehousing Corporation will come up through the Ministry of Food and Agriculture after the Bill is passed. Therefore Sir the present Bill is only an amending Bill and opportunity has been taken to have some minor amendments made in the Bill. Firstly the original Act covered only agricultural produce and ‘agricultural produce’ had been defined in that Act. And now besides agricultural produce any notified commodity is also being included. If Government wants to include any commodity for which Parliament is competent to legislate it can notify that commodity and apply the provisions of this measure to that commodity. In that case we will not have to come to Parliament again and again. Any commodity which is in the concurrent list and for which Parliament can legislate can be notified by Government for the application of these provisions. The second amendment is about the functional committees. In the present Act there is no provision for functional committees. Now this Corporation has to deal with credit processing marketing consumers and all these types of items in order to boost up the co-operative movement. We found that there was a lacuna and therefore we have suggested a provision to have functional committees. It is only an enabling provision and after this Bill becomes Act we will have functional committees regarding credit processing consumers etc. Then there was no power of delegation.",
50: "Before I come to other points I think it is necessary for me to deal with the substitute motion which has been moved by my hon. friend. Although it is in two parts really it comes to this that there is a suggestion that the coal target for the Third Five Year Plan may be revised upwards from the present 97 million tons. He said that this should be raised to 120 million tons and necessary transport arrangements should be made. If in our country our resources were such that we could find ourselves in an easy position obviously we should always plan in a little easy manner our targets for coal production transport power and some other basic things. But we have to take a realistic view. If our overall resources are limited financial and the like we have to make optimum use of whatever those resources are and we have to fit in various competing priorities within the overall resources. This is a matter which was discussed at great length when we were discussing some days ago our Third Five Year Plan. The Third Five Year Plan has now been approved by Parliament after a very lengthy and a detailed discussion in both Houses of Parliament. Howsoever tempting this idea may appear to be namely that we should plan for more transport for more coal for more power and for a number of other things which are basic they have to take their chance and they have to be fitted within the overall resources that are available. It is true that when the first exercises was made about the target for the Third Five Year Plan the working group that was entrusted with this task came almost to the conclusion that the figure should be round about 120 million tons. But I would like to share with the hon. House the processes that were gone through before the figure was arrived at. What should be the total requirement of steel to maintain a certain tempo of development in the course of the next five to ten years? We had to start somewhere. So we started with steel. With so much more steel what should be the additional quantity of coal that has to be raised not only to feed the steel plants but the additional transport that will be required for them? Therefore I would differ respectfully from the suggestion namely that it means only an additional Rs. 100 crores for increasing the production of coal from 97 million tons to 120 million tons. If it were really simple we could perhaps somehow or other find an additional Rs. 100 crores although every crore of rupees having been already taken into account it will be idle to talk of such a large addition as Rs. 100 crores. But it is not Rs. 100 crores that would be required but several hundreds of crores because to utilise that coal transport will have to be organised either by sea or by road or by rail. For the utilisation of that coal another heavy investment would be required in the form of consuming centres in the form of other new industrial plants or power plants or the like. We must not be too much obsessed by the present difficulties. By all means let us try to solve them; let us not form an exaggerated opinion of the overall requirements from the temporary shortages that we felt towards the end of the Second Plan period. Let us not think radically in revising upwards the figures which cannot I would repeat be revised singly. They are a part of an integrated whole. That means really in upward revision of the total size of the Plan by another 20 per cent or so which I think is a suggestion which I am afraid the Government cannot accept. Therefore I would submit the upward revision by that large quantity cannot be accepted although it is tempting. If I take a purely administrative view it is easy for me to say that this is a good suggestion and we should accept it. But we have to view that in the light of the overall requirements of the country the overall capacity of the country to consume and the overall capacity of the country to invest the financial resources and other organisational resources in order to be able to revise upward our total plan by that significant percentage. That I am afraid is not possible. Therefore this figure of 97 million tons which has been mentioned in the Plan has been arrived at after very careful consideration of the various requirements. Having said that much on the resources position I would like to say something about production. Hon. Members have given a great deal of thought to it and naturally the discussion has been somewhat discursive and a little overlapping which was quite natural when we are discussing such a wide subject.",
51: "Madam the Bill which has been moved just now has been rightly described by the Prime Minister as a non-controversial Bill and as a Bill which is very useful in order to develop the atomic energy in our country. The Bill provides for the regulation of radioactive and other prescribed substances which are to be used which are being handled which might be produced and which might be imported so that there may not be any hazards which are incidental to the handling of such substances and adequate rules are to be made regarding them. As far as these rule-making powers are concerned Madam there is one aspect of it which needs some consideration namely as far as the production of these substance in the country itself is concerned the establishments in which these substances are going to be produced are to be governed and controlled as far as the safety measures are concerned and as far as the Factory Acts are concerned by the Central Government. As far as this provision is concerned it is desirable because these are not just ordinary factories but these are factories that have to deal with certain substances for which special protection is necessary and perhaps the Atomic Energy Commission is the right authority to determine what type of protection is necessary for that. At the same time in the rule-making power which the Central Government has taken precaution should be taken to see that the safety measures regarding other aspects of the matter as far as the work of the labour in these factories is concerned are also of the same standard if not a better standard as those provided for in the Factories Act elsewhere. That is attention should not be concentrated only on the hazards incidental to the handling of these substances but other amenities to which the workers are entitled in ordinary factories should also provided for in any rules that might be made under this measure. Along with us precaution this power is absolutely necessary and therefore I support the same. Secondly there is the question of acquiring certain materials which might yield useful substances that are necessary for the development of atomic energy. The idea perhaps is to get all these materials within the control of the Atomic Energy Commission because these substances are very rare and they are to be conserved. This raises the question of research and the facilities for enquiry which might be available to an ordinary citizen who may not be fortunate enough to have some employment or admission into these atomic energy establishments. It is perhaps one of the conditions of modern life that any scientific research and enquiry involve dangerous implications so that they are to be controlled and coordinated under the aegis of the Government and to that extent perhaps the freedom of enquiry might be affected. But at the same time the history of scientific development has shown that all the worthwhile enquiries or many of the worthwhile enquiries and inventions have been made by people who are not easily amenable to any co-ordination or regulation of the type to which the government is normally accustomed and therefore some scope has to be left for free enquiry by these geniuses in the community also. I do not know how that can be done but perhaps one way of doing it will be to disseminate as much of scientific information as is possible in the community to the largest possible extent so that at least as far as the paper work is concerned no one is handicapped. I am just a layman and I am not quite acquainted with the various types of developments that are going on regarding the issues connected with the development of atomic energy. But there seems to be some indication that any worthwhile jump that will now come in this particular field is likely to be on the theoretical plane because as far as the practical aspects are concerned we have reached a dead-end and it is not possible to go beyond that. In view of this it is all the more necessary that as far as the theory is concerned and as far as the basic material connected with this theory is concerned it is disseminated to the largest possible extent in our community so that our people may become conscious of the type of work that is going on and of the type of work that is needed in order to make further progress in this field and various other fields in this country. Thirdly there is the question of acquiring certain mineral rights as far as these substances are concerned. Here again it is necessary that the authority should be centralised and obviously it would be in the hands of the Central Government and the Atomic Energy Commission. But again this also raises the further question of paying adequate attention to the interests of the States that are concerned in whose areas these mines are located.",
52: "Sir 1987 has been a year of persistent challenge and of determined response by the Government. It has been a year of achievement in the face of great difficulties. Some difficulties were caused by disruptive forces within the country some difficulties by disruptive forces inspired from abroad and some difficulties were caused by the weather. When in 1966-1967 Indiraji launched the green revolution she too was faced with similar difficulties weather difficulties. It was her farsightedness that has given our economy the strength and resilience with which it has met the present crisis with which we have been able to meet the present crises entirely through our efforts and our endeavour. We have not carried the begging bowl to anyone. We have not compromised on our freedom of action. At that time Indiraji’s strategy was opposed by many experts and technicians. It was opposed by certain myopic elements in the opposite benches. Indiraji prevailed because of her faith in the efforts of our kisans because of her confidence in the ability of our scientists because of her trust in the performance of our extension workers. She assured farmers of the required inputs at reasonable prices despite the burden of subsidising on our economy. She gave the farmers remunerative prices as the cardinal principle of the new strategy. She nationalised the banks to give credit at the doorstep of the farmer. She initiated a system of countrywide procurement to stabilise the prices that the farmers would get. Indiraji ensured that her strategy looked to the interests of all sections of our rural community not just the farmer but also the small and marginal cultivator landless labourer and even the rural artisan. We doubled our output in two decades because of her integrated vision of rural India her sympathy and understanding for each segment of our rural society because of her assiduous attention to inputs to costs and to subsidies. Today after four years of bad monsoon two years of poor rains followed by two years of severe drought we can hold our heads high and look to the future with confidence because Indiraji laid the foundations which were sure sound and secure. Our drive to maximise the rabi output is meeting with encouraging success. We hope to limit the shortfall to 10 per cent but the problem is not entirely over. During this past year we have done much to mitigate the distress of drought. Relief programmes have been handled efficiently by and large by all the States. The ceiling of assistance has been put at the high level of Rs. 1400 crore with almost half of it earmarked for Gujarat and Rajasthan as they were the most severely hit. Surcharges on taxes have been used so that the burden does not fall on the poor and only the rich have borne this burden. Using foodgrain buffer stocks we have launched programmes to generate employment to build assets to cushion against future droughts. Through worthwhile relief schemes we have ensured that expenditure on relief became expenditure on development. We have rushed fodder from areas of surplus to areas of scarcity. Special schemes for drinking water have been implemented and we have taken up special programmes for boosting the demand for the output of the village artisans and the handloom weavers. This is specially important because these are sections who normally get left out and they face very severe consequences of the side effects of a drought. The genesis of the Green Revolution was the scientific breakthrough which brought in new hybrid seeds. It was also a complete package of inputs to the irrigated land leading to self-sufficiency in foodgrains. We must now ensure that there is no levelling off of our foodgrains production. The scientific community must be galvanised into providing answers to the next phase of the Green Revolution of taking it to new areas expanding it to new crops and making it resilient to the vagaries of the weather. Already the special rice production programme is spreading throughout Eastern U.P. and is changing Eastern U.P. into the new granary of India. Dryland farming has been boosted by the technology mission on oilseeds and by the national project for pulses. The primary cause for our not surpassing the 1983-84 record foodgrains crop has been the weather and it would therefore be reasonable to hope for a better monsoon this year. Our objective must remain to regain the momentum of the Sixth Plan in the Seventh Plan. We will give a new thrust and a new impetus to agriculture. We have given careful attention to agricultural already. I have held review meetings at various levels and I have given specific directions to the Planning Commission to revamp the plan for agriculture. I have instructed them to reorder the priorities to give agriculture the highest importance. I have asked them to furnish a detailed district-wise crop plan for the coming season.",
53: "Mr. Speaker Sir yesterday the hon. Minister and today the Chairman of the Select Committee have fully explained the various clauses of the Bill and certain important changes that have been effected by the Select Committee. I propose to confine myself to two or three important features of the Bill which require re-examination and close attention by the Government. Sir I need hardly emphasise the important role which the electricity supply undertakings play in the national economy of the country. Indeed the development in other spheres depends upon the full development of the supply of power and this Bill is of vital importance affecting as it does the development of electric supply undertakings in the country. I am focussing attention on the role that the private electricity undertakings are playing in the supply of electric power with a view to drawing the attention of Government to the difficulties that are bound to be faced by these electricity undertakings in one or two directions. In this connection I would not therefore like to take much of the time of the House but I would like to draw the attention of the hon. Minister to what my hon. friend Shri Tulsidas has stated and with whose comments I am in full agreement. As a matter of fact the approach of the Government to the Bill is to fulfil three basic considerations so vital for the healthy growth of this industry. Firstly that its proper control and regulation is but necessary. I fully agree that this is subject to certain differences on basic aspects but the important consideration governing this Bill is to attempt at providing suitable incentives to the industry which alone can enable it to increase its capacity to the desired extent. Therefore I would like to refer to the incentives as provided in the Bill and to the need for liberalising the clause in respect of the fair return to the investors in these undertaking. I would like to draw the attention of the hon. Minister to the fact that since the passing of the original Act in 1948 only 8 States throughout the country have constituted the statutory electricity boards. Among these States are Madhya Pradesh West Bengal Tamil Nadu Kerala Rajasthan Punjab Orissa and Maharashtra and therefore we find that many of the States have still to constitute these electricity Boards. I would like to know from the hon. Minister why in the matter of the constitution of Electricity Boards many of the States have not implemented the provisions of the Bill and what the Central Government have done to ensure that these electricity boards are constituted in all the States as desired in the provisions of the original Act. Perhaps it may have been the problem of taxation which some of the States may have in view while not proceeding with the constitution of the electricity boards but whatever might be the reason and even as far as this question of taxation is concerned the Central Government may have to lay down some sort of subvention or such other assistance as is found necessary. I think that this matter of the constitution of the electricity boards throughout all the States is of vital importance and should be looked into by the Central Government to ensure that necessary steps are taken in the remaining States for the constitution of these boards. I would now like to say something about the deferred taxation reserve about which the hon. Minister yesterday said that the amendment regarding this has been brought forward at the instance of the Federation of Electricity Undertakings. The whole complication arises due to the fact that the provisions of the Income tax Act and the provisions of the Electricity Supply Act are contradictory to each other. While the Income tax Act with an accelerated depreciation in earlier years results in larger tax relief in the earlier period and thereby the tax liability of the undertakings is deferred for a future period the Electricity Supply Act restricts the provision of depreciation to a much lesser degree and to that extent the profits of the electricity undertakings in regard to the Income-tax development and depreciation rates are restricted. That Act lays down a smaller depreciation as compared to what is allowed under the Indian Income tax Act. What has now been done has been put with certain restrictions that it does not really solve the demand that was put forward by the Federation. As a matter of fact if the electricity undertakings should have been allowed to set aside that reserve for taxation liability for future years out of the profits which they earn year by year out of the rate increase which they have put into force from time to time that would have met the needs of the situation but the clause as it has emerged would rather create more difficulties than solve them and it has therefore been further represented to the Minister by the Federation of Electricity Undertakings.",
54: "Mr. Chairman the discussion on the resolution put forward by Mr. Sinha and the substitute motion put forward by Mr. Das has turned out to be a discussion in the nature of a general discussion of the Budget of the All India Radio. I do not want to go into all the considerations which have been put forward but I want to say one thing about the substitution motion that has been put forward by Mr. Das. I think in India we are developing a passion for having Committees and Commissions. We want a Committee or a Commission for every blessed thing that there is in India. I think there are millions and millions of things in India. I would say that before we think of having any other Commission or Committee appointed we should first of all read the reports of those Committees and Commissions which are before us digest them and take action on them and then think of doing something else. For instance what is the record of the Ministry of Broadcasting in the matter of the Film Enquiry Committee Report? They have now the Press Commission’s Report. The two bodies have been set up by this Ministry. What action has been taken on the Film Enquiry Committee and what action is going to be taken on the Report of the Press Commission? I think that the Press Commission’s Report may be thrown into cold storage. We will not allow it to be thrown into cold storage. I know what has happened to the Report of the Film Enquiry Committee. Therefore I say that this passion for Committees and Commissions should be curbed and we should not run away with the idea that the Commissions will provide the panacea for all our ills and that a Committee will cure all our difficulties and troubles. Therefore I think it is no use appointing a Commission at this stage to go into the question of broadcasting. There is another thing. My friend has been asking for the appointment of a Corporation. I am a Member of the Lok Sabha and if you ask me to be a party to the appointment of a Corporation it would be tantamount to this that I abrogate almost all my responsibilities and privileges as a Member of the Lok Sabha. I was saying that the needs is for direct control. The control should be slackened for a minute. Unless it is done I am sure the lines on which these persons want the Radio to develop will not be possible. Why I say that there should be perpetual vigilance on the part of Parliament is for this reason. If there is Corporation my hon. friend the Minister of Information and Broadcasting will be the most happy person. He will have all the privileges which he is having now and he will not have the necessity of coming before us to give answers to our questions and to submit to us reports. He will have all the privileges and very little responsibility for that. I say that the control which the Parliament exercises over the All India Radio at the time of the Budget is sufficient to make these people wake up. It is sufficient to make these people active who are slack; it is sufficient for those people who practice nepotism to be fair; and if there is a Corporation the whole thing will go away and we shall not have any control over the All India Radio. Now we have control over appointments through the Public Service Commission and if we have a Corporation I do not think you will have that control. We have control over the All India Radio on account of the Public Accounts Committee and the Estimates Committee. My friends have said that the Estimates Committee has suggested 92 improvements to be made in the All India Radio. I think that shows how effectively and how comprehensively the work has been done. When work of that kind is being done by the Estimates Committee and the Public Accounts Committee and when the whole thing comes before the House I do not see why we should have a Corporation of this kind. We in India in this transitional era are suffering from self-contradictory impulses. On the one hand I see on the floor of this house something being said that we should not take this country or that country as our model and on the other hand a gentleman wants us to follow the BBC model or some other model. That is a self-contradictory impulse. Somewhere in the 1954 issue of this Quarterly I find an article not eulogising the Corporation but an article on the subject of the ills of the British Broadcasting Corporation. The Gentleman has gone into the question and given us the reason for that and also the remedies for that. I would therefore say that we do not need a Corporation.",
55: "As far as Khadi is concerned my own practical experience is that the Khadi Board does not have sufficient number of centers especially in the areas which are the most backward. For instance in the Sunderbans area which has only one crop a year and which is actually very poor and backward as far as industrialisation goes we find hardly any centers either purchasing or training centers. The other thing we note is that the individual who is spinning at home does not know where to take the yarn because there is no publicity or propaganda to help the individual spinners to go and sell their yarn with the result that although large amounts of subsidy are being given by Government it is not going to the help of the majority of those who are today wanting some form of cottage industry employment. That is why I feel that it is very essential now that is being done on a national scale that Government purchasing and training centers should be opened in the areas which are most backward so that we may notice this type of shortfall at a time when in every village to which you go the women especially the agricultural laboring women crowd round you and ask you how you are going to give them some form of employment. The other thing I want to stress is the question of village industries. This is especially a thing in which a certain amount of research is also required. In these areas I am afraid nothing has been done although we approach the Industries Department again and again. Nobody in the village knows who is the competent authority to tell them how to approach Government for help for research for the result of research for production centers for training or for marketing. If we go to the sub-divisional officer he is not able to tell us. The whole thing is in such a state of flux that actually the money which is being given is not being utilized by the people who are starving due to unemployment. Some of them have the technical skill also. Some are anxious to find new ways and methods of developing these industries. Yet that is not being done and I am afraid it is one of the biggest drawbacks of this entire Ministry and it should be removed very quickly. I think one of the reasons why this shortfall is taking place is the big difference and gap between the sums of money for which we are budgeting and passing in this House and its actual utilization and reaching the masses who are so eager for employment and who are suffering from so much poverty due to employment. I am in sympathy with the observations made by the previous speaker because as one who has been connected with one of these Boards I have felt a lot of difficulties in expediting the work and spending the money allotted. I feel that the whole organization does require modification so far as the organizational aspect is concerned. It is known that the Government’s method of doing anything is rather slow and tardy the procedure is very difficult and prolonged. And here we have to deal not with one particular section of the people or industry fixed at a particular place. The whole activity is spread over the villages long distances and families whose condition the non- officials are in the best position to know and appreciate. Here the Secretary the Deputy Secretary or the Under Secretary is sitting in some office or the Deputy Minister or Minister is sitting somewhere surrounded by Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries. He knows their point of view only. He is obsessed with certain formalities etc. He is not obsessed with the condition of the poor people and their difficulties are not realised so much as the difficulties of the secretariat. That is the real problem and that has to be tackled. As a matter of fact the question of having a statutory has been hanging fire for a long time. The Khadi and Village Industries Board consists of a very good set of people who are very enthusiastic who are people with missionary zeal; they have been doing this work all their life. They are on this Board but they find themselves handicapped because they cannot function independently. They are tied down by so many rules and regulations and all kinds of forms and formalities. We must trust these people who have devoted their life to this work; their main aim in life has been to work for these people. It is high time that we made this body a statutory body. I understand that such a demand had been made by them and I hear that even a Bill had been drafted for that purpose. I would like to know why nothing has been done so far in that direction and why it was ignored. The Government of India should take immediate action in this matter.",
56: "Madam Chairman I am glad that we are having a debate on the European Common Market. I wish that it had taken place earlier. Had Parliament been in session when the Minister of Aviation of the U.K. visited Delhi it would have had an opportunity for arming Government with its views thus helping it in formulating the statement but at any rate indicating to the world at large that Parliament is fully behind the Finance Minister in the Statement that he has made. The statement that has been made by the Finance Minister is admirable both in content and in tone. The problems that face us as a result of the emergence of the common market of Europe cannot be by-passed. Whether we like it or not the future is with continental economies and the emergence of the European Common Market of Europe is one of the steps in this direction. No one can deny the stakes that we have in the matter of entry of the United Kingdom into the common market of Europe. I have done some research into the actual position of our trade and I think it would perhaps help the House to estimate the magnitude of the problem that is facing us. We are importing 35 per cent of our imports from Western Europe including U.K. We are exporting about 40 per cent of our goods to this area. We have a large interest in the outcome of U.K.’s entry into the Common Market and the terms on which she proposes to enter into the Common Market. In the present circumstances we cannot visualize what the terms will be. But we know that our stakes are great and we have already indicated our deep interest in the terms which the U.K. would be able to negotiate. But having made our standpoint clear it would be upbecoming of us to do anything else except to be prepared for all eventualities. I want the House to realise that while undoubtedly this is a great challenge we ought to be prepared and not content ourselves with giving expression to certain views which might give the impression to the outside world that we are in a state of panic. To suggest for instance that the pattern of our trade should be changed overnight is not realistic. A changeover in trade is no solution. My hon. friend Shri Krishna Reddy pointed out that our balance of payments was most unfavourable with Germany. I know that it has been unfavourable and while partly this is due to Germany imposing very high tariffs let us realise that we have had to depend for aid and capital from the developed countries notable Germany and as such our balance of payments is bound to be unfavourable. It has been recommended by my friend that we ought to think of the pattern of trade being changed so that the Eastern European countries might be our main customers. Before us the advantages of rupee credit and rupee payments are dangled. I only want to sound a note of caution. While it is true that from the point of view of our immediate difficulties rupee payments offer a solution in the sense of imports not being a current draft on our foreign exchange resources we ought not to suffer from the delusion that we are getting something for nothing. Nor can we think that these rupee payments which are made may not work to our disadvantage. I do not propose to go into this question today since the issues that merit consideration are different. I hope that Parliament will have an opportunity of discussing the whole scheme of rupee payments on some other occasion so that we might have an opportunity of weighing the advantages and disadvantages of such rupee payments. No one for a moment objects to diversified pattern of trade a structure of trade which is not dependent on any particular grouping of nations. We have emphasized to a certain extent this diversified structure of trade; probably in the future we have to emphasise it even more. But what is the position today? As it is the terms which can be arranged for U.K.’s entry into the Common Market are not dependent on that country alone. They are dependent on others as well. This is the position which we face. We should now find out how best we can line with this situation. There is one thing which has to be affirmed on this occasion. I hope Parliament will affirm it because there is a danger of our overlooking it. To the extent that we suffer by the new groupings in Europe the moral responsibility of those countries to compensate us in all the greater. This would be in conformity with the trend of modern things. In a modern welfare state if an individual derives a compensation or reparation that comes into operation in such a case.",
57: "First of all I would like to thank the Members of this House all those who have spoken and all those who have even moved cut motions for the interest that they have evinced for the cause of health. I agree entirely with so many friends who have said that far too little time is given to this House for discussion and exchange of views on a subject which is so vital to the progress of the country. It is undoubtedly a nation- building activity to cater to the health of the people committed to the charge of any government and if we are not able to give enough attention to these problems and if we are not able to give enough money to improve the standards of health I am of course convinced that we shall not really make the progress that we want this country to make. I am however heartened by the fact that the countryside is health conscious. Anywhere that I go the two things that the villager demands are medical aid and relief and schools for his children. And I believe that anything the people the masses demand will certainly come about. I would like to comment on the points that have been raised by the various speakers. First of all everybody has welcomed the malaria control programme. I am very happy to be able to say that at the end of the First Five Year Plan we shall have covered 125 millions of the population from the risk of malaria and I sincerely hope that by the end of the Second Five Year Plan practically the entire country will have been covered. And that certainly means a tremendous asset to the nation because those poor people who used to be laid out for four months in a year with malaria will now be able to help in the production which is so vitally needed for progress. Then a comment has been made on the Community Projects. I think I ought to say that I have from the very beginning ever since I was charged with serving the Ministry of Health laid the greatest emphasis on medical aid and relief to the rural population in particular because they have been sadly neglected up to date. I think it is impossible for a long time to come to give all hospital facilities for people. The first thing therefore that I took up was maternal and child welfare and I am glad to be able to say that a great deal of progress has been made in maternal and child welfare. These Centres have increased enormously. While I agree entirely with my friend that we have not of course got enough Health Centres in rural areas or enough personnel I think the creation of the personnel the creation of the Health Centres the creation of the Maternity and Child Welfare Centres is going ahead with a fair amount of speed. I was delighted when I went the other day of Bhopal to see in the remotest villages that the villagers themselves have built up maternity and Child Welfare Centres and Government have put qualified women to look after them. The care of the child is certainly our greatest responsibility and the fact that the death rate per thousand of the estimated population has decreased during these last seven years speaks I think in evidence of the fact that infant and maternal care is now receiving of the care that it merits. I hope that in these community project areas in the secondary health centres which I would like to come into the National Extension Service Blocks still further care will be given to maternal and child needs so that we may be able to serve this part of the population better than we have done so far. A sum of Rs. 50 lakhs has been given by the Centre especially for maternity and child welfare in the backward areas. Another sum of Rs. 50 lakhs is being offered to the States again from the Centre apart from what the Planning Commission is doing for this vital work. Of course health is a State subject. Many things that have been said by way of criticism levelled at me should really be levelled at the State Governments. I have stated very clearly in the preamble to this report what the Central Ministry of Health is responsible for. I hope that hon. Members of this House who have perused this report with the care that it merits will be able to give the Central Ministry of Health a certificate that in all the subjects that are under their care this Ministry has not been at all negligent. I know no one is more dissatisfied than I myself at the slow progress that we have made in the matter of provision of health services to the people. But with the limited resources at our disposal I claim that we have made the most of what has been given to us.",
58: "Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir before I say anything about defence I would like to congratulate the Home Ministry on the splendid work it has done in connection with the improvement of the conditions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The present Home Minister and his Ministry are not spending money on good schemes as used to be done in the past. They have got very many schemes and those schemes are really worth spending lot of money. They are really for the benefit of these communities. I was going to ask the Home Ministry to set up a separate fund for the constructin of houses for these communities since the Ministry concerned with housing had completely neglected this problem which is facing these communities. Even the Planning Commission in the last Five Year Plan has not done much in this regard. I think even in the Second Five Year Plan there is no definite plan for providing housing facilities for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. But since the Housing Minister has promised that he is going to constitute a Board to go into these things I do not think there is any need for me to stress this point any more. About the Board which is going to be constituted I would definitely like to say a few words. This Board I believe is going to consist of some members of the Harijan community and also a number of members belonging to Non-Harijan communities. In any case I would very much like that this Board which will of course function under the Home Ministry should have as its chairman a non-Harijan. I want to stress this point because I know that in some of the States where the portfolio of Harijan welfare is given to a Harijan Minister he is not able to do his work properly. It is not because he cannot do it it is not that he is not efficient enough to do it but because everytime he speaks about the welfare of Scheduled Castes and measures to be taken to improve their conditions he is generally looked down by the other members of the Cabined as a communalist. If the same thing is done by a member belonging to a non-Harijan community he will be considered to be doing a national service. Therefore the chairmanship should go to a non-Harijan. The Second Five Year Plan I understand is going to be an industrial plan. Many industries are going to be established in this country. Therefore I feel it my duty to say that the Ministries concerned with heavy industries should take proper care in setting up new industries in places which are not very well developed. For instance if a heavy industry is set up only in one State all the ancillary factories crop up in that particular State and the benefits are deprived only by the people of that State. Even in the case of employment in those factories it is always observed that the people belonging to that particular State get the preference and the people belonging to other stages do not get any benefit out of it. Therefore the Ministry should take proper care to see that these heavy industries are located in such places that they cater not only to one particular State but can also cater to more than one State. For instance if a factory is located in the centre of a State the benefits of it will be derived only by the people of that particular State. There is a factory in Madras the Perambur Coach Factory which is producing coaches. That is located in the heart of the city of Madras. It cannot help the people of either Andhra or Kerala. If the same factory were to be located on the borders there may be so many ancillary industries feeder industries in Andhra or in Kerala. Because it is located in the heart of the city of Madras only the people of the State could make any profit out of it. Therefore I appeal to the Ministry concerned to take proper steps to locate the future industries in such places so that they could be of help not only to one State but be of help to more than one State. In Hyderabad there is a place which produces thermal power but there are no industries to make use of that power. Repeated requests have been made by the Government of Hyderabad but the Ministry at the Centre is not at all taking any notice of it. I think if a factory to produce electrical goods or a small fertilizer factory or a small engineering factory were to be located at that particular placethat will be able to cater not only to the Hyderabad State but also to Andhra and other places as well. Therefore it is necessary that steps should be taken to see that heavy industries are located not in one particular State but on the borders of States.",

60: "During the last general elections the government found on careful consideration that it would not have been possible to provide such facilities without rousing criticism of unfairness and partiality from one group or the other. However after the elections the Government have given careful though to the matter. Practices prevailing in other democratic countries have also been studied and compared. It is well to remember that examples of other countries that can be cited in this behalf are not uniform and are based on conditions which differ radically in many important respects from country to country. The practical aspect of the question has also great importance. The area of the country the form of Government federal or unitary and the number of parties involved all are factors which have been kept in mind by various countries in taking a decision. In USA where broadcasting is run by private enterprise though certain principles of equal opportunity have been laid down by the Federal Communications Commission in practice it is a rare occurrence because time has to be purchased and a great deal of bickering and dissatisfaction always exists. In Great Britain only since war opportunities have been provided for a few election broadcasts the allotment of time being subject to the strength of the parties and other practical considerations. In countries like Switzerland no time is permitted for election purpose on the radio while in France it is given though the time allotted is extremely short five minutes or less. It is clear from a study of foreign practices that each country has taken the conditions prevailing there and also the number of parties and other factors into consideration. The anology of other countries therefore is of not much validity in coming to any conclusion as far as India is concerned. Taking into consideration the conditions prevailing in our country the government feel that it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to make satisfactory arrangements for giving such facilities to all political parties. Besides the points mentioned above another important factor has to be considered. In other countries for national broadcasting only one language is used and that too only in national elections. The exception is Switzerland where there are three languages that it is one of the important reasons that Switzerland does not permit the use of the national radio for election purposes and even for commercial purposes. In India we are confronted with the task of providing facilities in 12 languages besides English and they would be asked to give equal facilities from stations of All India Radio which are 26 in number. Moreover in working out any practical formula it has to be remember that the number of parties which will have to be provided with these facilities comes to nearly 26. The apportionment of time between the various political parties and at different stations of the A.I.R. would be a task of extreme difficulty and is bound to lead to criticism and partiality. The determination of the principle for purposes of allocation of time will also lead to much controversy. Language stations of regional centres of A.I.R. might have to cater to a large number of parties and provide them with time for broadcast in at least two or three languages and sometimes more. Apportionment of time is made in different countries in different manners some doing it on the number of votes polled others on the number of candidates put up by parties. We feel that any such apportionment would result in rescriminations and criticism of Government. On the other hand if all parties have to be provided with equal time the normal activities of the A.I.R. stations will have to be drastically curtailed during the election time. The proposal to provide broadcasting time in a fair and reasonable manner therefore seems almost insoluble in practice. In view of these practical considerations Government have come to the conclusion that it would not be possible to allow political parties generally to utilize the facilities of the radio for election purposes. However Government feel that an experiment permitting such utilization on a restricted scale might be tried. In order to see whether such facilities can be used for specific election purposes without taking a major part of the time of the radio and also without leading to a charge of discrimination or partiality it has been decided that the four all-India parties recognised by the Election Commission might be allowed the facility of supplying a summary of their election manifestoes prepared by themselves which will be broadcast by A.I.R. subject to usual rules. Such summaries might not exceed ten minutes and will be broadcast in English and in all the regional languages of the country. If this opportunity is allowed at least to the leading political parties of the country it will surely further strengthen the system of democratic government in the country and will provide healthy and fair conditions for fighting the general elections.",
61: "The President’s Address makes mention of the Code of Discipline and the happy industrial relations which are developing in the country. This Code of Discipline is a very good thing. But I am sorry to say that the success claimed for it has not come as yet. The employers in the country have not accepted this Code of Discipline in its spirit. They have not accepted it voluntarily. They have not shown by their conduct that they understand and appreciate the spirit of the Code of discipline and something will have to be done about it. The Code of Discipline can bring about better harmonious relations. It can bring about better industrial relations and it can create conditions in which the industrial production in the country will go up by leaps and bounds. Industrialists in the private sector and some of the bureaucrats in the public sector do not accept this Code of Discipline and unless the Ministry of Labour does something drastic about it unless the Ministry of Labour does something which would make the non-observance of this Code on the part of the employers a penal offence. I am afraid the spirit of the Code would be defeated. The Ministry of Labour has done well in bringing forward a Code of Efficiency and Welfare. There is as yet not enough agreement on that Code even from the labour’s point of view. But I am sure efforts to further the acceptance of this Code of Efficiency and Welfare will be continued and if that is done it will be a great help to industrial production in the country. In the matter of the Bonus Commission Sir the progress made has been disappointing. It was as early as January 1961 that the hon. Labour Minister announced the appointment of the Commission. The progress made in respect of the Bonus Commission during the last fourteen months has been that its terms of reference have been settled and its constitution has been agreed upon. That I am afraid is very slow speed in the direction of the solution of a problem whose solution is so very important. The President has correctly mentioned the great objective of securing workers participation in the management and the establishing of joint management councils. But the most important thing is that the gains or the profits should be shared by the toilers. A share of the produce of their toil should come back to those who toil. The acceptance of profit-sharing is an old thing. It was accepted by those responsible for the industrial truce fourteen years back. But we are yet to evolve a satisfactory formula. The full-Bench formula of the Labour appellate tribunal repeatedly approved and endorsed by the orthodox Judges of the Supreme Court is not solution of the problem. It just denies the workers their due share in the profits. It was because of this peculiar situation that the need of appointment of the Bonus Commission was accepted by all parties. But what we now find is that it has taken them fourteen months to decide the terms of reference of the Commission and I do not know when we can expect its report. The members of the Bonus Commission should be directed by the government to find an early solution to this important problem. Similarly I must point out that the delay in the matter of evolving a consolidated scheme of social security for industrial workers is a dangerous thing. We have today a number of social security schemes. But none of them looks after the workers in his old age. The Government of Uttar Pradesh made a provision that the discharge of workers because of ill-health or old age should be treated as retrenchment. But we have now the verdict of the High Court of Allahabad that this cannot be done. The result is that while workers in industrial establishments today are covered against the risk of ill-health there is no insurance against the risk of old age. There is no scheme of gratuity which the industry has to follow. There is no old-age pension scheme which the industries in the country have to adhere to. The result is that there is a big gap or disparity in the lives of the workers who are in employment and those who are out of it particularly those who are thrown out of employment because of old-age or continued ill-health. Therefore something should be done about it as soon as possible and there should be some sort of a scheme to see that the worker after meritorious service to the industry got at least the equivalent of a retrenchment relief when he retired due to old age or continued ill-health. That is a pressing problem. We know that in Kanpur industrialists have adopted the practice of terminating the employment of workers merely by giving them 12 days notice. The worker is told that he has been found to be unfit.",
62: "I would like briefly to give the background under which this bill has been brought forward by the government. The house is aware that this institution has been in existence now for nearly half a century. It was established in 1910 and since then it has rendered very valuable service for the promotion of Hindi and through holding various conferences it focussed the attention of the country to the great importance of Hindi as a national language. The institution has rendered valuable service in various other ways also. It has been conducting examinations. It has also been affiliating institutions which are doing similar kind of work in the field of Hindi and it has branches in various parts of the country. The institution has also built up a library which probably contains almost all the books which have been published in Hindi so far and it has a valuable collection of manuscripts. I understand that it is one of the best in the whole country. It conducts various examinations and these examinations have been recognized by the Government. It has also on its rolls a large number of members. Some differences have arisen among the members and the activities of the institution have been paralysed. After the declaration of Hindi as the official language it was thought by the Sammelan that it was necessary to amend its constitution. Therefore at the Hyderabad session of the Sammelan held in March 1949 a resolution was passed for the amendment of the constitution and a committee of 21 members was appointed to frame the rules and place its recommendations before a special session of the Sammelan to be held at Patna. This committee did prepare a draft constitution for the Sammelan and it was placed before the Patna session of the Sammelan. But unfortunately at this session differences arose among the members and after a good deal of discussion it was decided ultimately to entrust the Framing of the constitution to a committee of eleven persons with this proviso that a constitution signed by eight members shall be deemed to be approved by the general session of the Sammelan. This committee prepared a constitution and it was considered by the session of the committee held in December. At this session differences arose among the members and the Sammelan was not able to hold its session. The situation now is that the institution is in the hands of an official receiver. He has done good work but obviously at the present moment because he is only an honorary person looking after the institution he cannot give much time and the institution had not been doing the work for which it was established several years back. Various efforts have been made to bring about some kind of a settlement but all these efforts have failed. Ultimately the Uttar Pradesh Government had to intervene and pass the Act of 1956. This Act was also in the nature of an interim measure. But the Act of the U.P Government was challenged in the High Court at Allahabad and it was declared ultra vires mainly on the ground and it created a corporation with objects not confined to one state and the Court said that legislation could he passed only by Parliament. We have been receiving various representations from people who are interested in the welfare of this institution and the promotion of Hindi and the Government have therefore thought it proper to declare this institution as an institution of national importance and to rescue the institution which has unfortunately fallen into evil days. This is the main purpose for which this Bill has been brought forward. The special features of this Bill are these. We are proposing to appoint a Governing Body which will consist of a Chairman a Secretary and thirteen other members all to be appointed by the Central Government. But this will only be an interim measure. This Bill empowers the Governing Body to make with the approval of the Central Government the rules of the Sammelan. It will also set up a properly constituted Government body which will take charge of the institution in course of time. The House will note that in clause 12 of the Bill the Governing body has been empowered to make with the approval of the Central Government rules of the Sammelan in respect of matters relating to membership including the qualifications and disqualifications for membership of the Sammelan the powers and functions of the Governing body the conduct of election for the constitution of the Governing body and the decisions on doubt and disputes at or in connection with these elections. It is also proposed that the accounts of this institution should be audited by a chartered accountant. The Government of India have a certain responsibility in the promotion of Hindi and the House is aware that the Government have taken various measures to promote Hindi throughout the country during the last several years.",
63: "You have rightly stated that the principle of this Bill has been unanimously accepted by the House and most of the relevant points have been made out and that no time of the House should be taken by repeating the same points again and again. One of the Points on which I want to lay stress and which is being disputed again and again by the Treasury Benches is the question of cottage industries. Though you pointed out to them yesterday that there is provision in this Bill to take into consideration the cottage industries also and the hon. the Deputy Minister realised it again there was a point raised by Mr. Sidhva today and the hon. Speaker who was in the Chair at the time said that the scope of the Bill is confined only to the consideration of protection to industries as against foreign industries i.e. to give protection to the indigenous industries as against imported goods and the question of cottage industry does not come in here. The hon. Deputy Ministry dittoed this. Unless protection is given to indigenous industries we shall not be able to develop industrially. I whole-heartedly support this proposition. I am not against it. When I speak of cottage industries I do not for a moment think that our country should not be developed on the same lines as the other countries in the world. I want that every villager should have the same amenities that we sitting in this House have. Every villager should have these furnitures fittings houses and so on. The only thing is that the existing economy should not be disturbed and sacrificed before substitute arrangement is made. Before we give protection to any bigger industries the first thing we should consider is that the materials which are at present being produced in our villages to meet the requirements of our villages and on which the economic life of the villagers rests are properly safeguarded. We should see that we have sufficient quantity of consumer goods to meet the necessities of all people in the country and nothing is done merely in the interest of 10 per cent of the people at the sacrifice of existing village economy before making sure of some better substitute. I find that at the present moment our attention is confined to the amenities and requirements of a portion of the population only. The other day my hon. friend Mr. Krishnamachari whom I regard as a great economist and who knows finance etc. and looks to the interests of the country and gives very good advice said that we do not want to go to medieval age and the luxury of yesterday is the necessity of today and that few articles which we import today from many foreign countries and the few industries which we are starting for recreation and amenities of the people should not be grudged. I agree with him. I do not grudge them. But looking to the condition as it is today and the circumstances under which we are placed and over which we have no control if we want to develop our country on the same basis as other countries have done industrially and otherwise we do not have at our command all the necessary materials and we simply cannot do it with the speed we want. We have to depend upon others. So at least during the transitional period it may be that the necessities of yesterday may have to be regarded as the luxuries of today and for some time have to take to austerity to be squarely distributed. I welcomed this Bill most heartily when I went through it but when the Deputy Minister was speaking he probably overlooked or gave scant attention to one points. I am referring to clause 12 in regard to the reference to the Commission of matters arising out of protection. Of the things mentioned there is the different sectors of the country’s economy on which the Commission may enquire and report. Whenever we start new industries and give protection to them this clause is always neglected. It should not be merely that the Central Government ‘may’ also refer but they ‘must’ refer to this as one of the conditions under Clause 14. When the fiscal Commission recommends that this tariff Commission should take so many points into consideration the different sectors of the country’s economy must be one of the points that must be taken into consideration. The other day there was a question about the acquisition of the Vizagapatnam Shipping Yard. When we had to pay Rs. two to three crores for acquiring it one of the points we took into consideration was the unemployment of 4000 workers and for keeping them in employment we suffered a loss in view of the agitation that was carried on. We sacrifice the existing necessary supply of the villagers and throw them out of employment without making any arrangement for their substitute requirements and without providing them with alternative employment.",
64: "Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir may I with your permission intervene and say a few words in regard to the various matters that have been discussed? My colleague the Finance Minister who is in charge of this particular Budget will no doubt deal with the specific matters that have been raised in the course of this debate. I need hardly remind the House of the fact that although this Budget is the individual responsibility of the Finance Minister it is also the responsibility of the entire Government and as Prime Minister I am entirely responsible for it as well as any other member of the Govt. This Budget was placed before the House after the usual consideration by the Government and the latter is completely committed to it. That does not mean that we are not willing to consider any new proposals; we certainly are so long as the basic structure of the budget is not affected. My friend the hon. Prof. Shah pointed out various difficulties in the way of a debate here and in the way of consideration of the Budget proposals. He pointed out how little could be done in the allotted time. I am in complete agreement with him in this matter. If there are any practical proposals which would enable us to give more time for the consideration of these problems either formally or informally I am quite sure that the Finance Minister will gladly consider them. The real difficulty is however more basic and it is this. The kind of problems which the Government has to face now is so vast and intricate that it is impossible for any democratic parliamentary assembly to give enough time for its consideration. It is just a question of time. This is not a new difficulty. I remember that long debates on this subject took place in a country like the United Kingdom where they found that they could not get along with what is really the 19th century procedure in this 20th century of continuous crises social problems and international problems. So even parliamentary procedure in the United Kingdom has gradually changed and many matters are left more to the Committees than to the House itself. Usually a principle is decided by the House and its working out is left to Committees. The House cannot find time to consider everything. That is a difficulty inherent in the situation. If we can find a remedy for it it will not only be good for us but maybe we will be setting an example for other democratically inclined countries who are seeking such remedies. In spite of the fact that Parliament is in continuous session it is not able to find time to consider in detail all the important matters that come up. We have in fact much less time because we are not in continuous session. I suppose our sessions will inevitably become longer and longer so as to enable us to deal with more and more problems and have more and more discussions. Anyhow I have stated what the difficulty is at present. Though I am in sympathy with what Prof. Shah said I have no easy remedy for that difficulty except to say that we are perfectly prepared to consider together with the Hon. Members of the House any ideas or suggestions about how to give greater facilities for more intensive discussion of any great problem. An hon. Member referred to the Budget speech as being directly or indirectly a survey of all manner of problems- domestic international economic foreign etc. The House can hardly expect the Finance Minister’s Budget speech to be a survey of all these tremendous problems although they have no doubt some bearing on the Budget. The world is becoming far too intricate and difficult for us to be able to keep the full picture in view always. As I listened to the hon. Member who spoke just now I was wondering whether we had the larger picture in mind or were getting lost in few minor and secondary matters. For instance having referred to the Government’s extravagance the hon. Member went on to say certain things in regard to our bringing forward a Bill for giving a pension to the President. That signified to me an approach which I would call hundred per cent wrong. Besides I should have thought that the subject of pension for the president was hardly a matter for debate or reference here. I say even if this country is starving even then you have to provide for our President. The hon. Member perhaps prefers starvation for the President and himself. I certainly will not stand in his way. But we are considering graver matters than this; and the fact that such points are raised shows that we are not looking at the problems. We do not seem to be thinking of the vast problems that we are faced with and have to wrestle with the vast problem of the country’s economy in relation to the world’s economy.",
65: "The hon. Member who has just spoken has dealt with certain wider questions which appear to me to go beyond the scope of the present Bill which is a short Bill before the House. The House will remember that when this Commission was appointed they were entrusted with two tasks. One was to examine the whole income-tax procedure and suggest ways and means to avoid or prevent evasion in future. Secondly they were to examine specific cases which were referred to them. What the hon. Member has been saying really refers to the first part that is the wider question. As has been stated I believe in the Statements of Objects and Reasons we have received from the Income Tax Investigation Commission recommendations on this wider issue and they will no doubt come up before the House in the form of a measure and the House will then have full opportunities of considering them adding to them or altering them so that we might evolve a proper procedure. The sole question before the House now is what to do with the inquiry part of the Commission’s work with regard to certain cases that were referred to them. Now I would beg the House to remember that this is not a roving inquiry. This inquiry has been confined to a certain number of specific cases referred to them up to a certain date; no further cases can come up before them. Apart from that a fair number of all the cases that have been referred to them has been disposed of and a large number still remains and this Bill is limited to those particular cases and none other. It does not affect the larger issue and obviously the larger issue cannot be considered in the form of amendments to this particular Bill which is meant to give an opportunity to the Commission of Inquiry to complete its task in those specific cases which have been entrusted to it. This matter would normally of course have been dealt with by my hon. colleague the Finance Minister. Unfortunately he is not here but I should like to inform the house that next only to the Finance Minister I have taken a great deal of interest in the work of this Commission more perhaps than any other of my colleagues. Of course the Finance Minister will be better able to deal with it. I have also been fairly closely connected with the matter in the sense that I have attached great importance to this work and I have occasionally had talks with the members of the Commission to find out how they were getting on. May I say that the criticism that has been made I think yesterday by a hon. Member about the rather sorry result of their labours appears to me totally unjustified? I feel their labours have resulted in very substantial and very good results. They have labored under great difficulties and in spite of that they have proceeded calmly and steadily with their work in the highest judicial traditions. And the House will member that the Chairman of this Commission is one of our most eminent and respected Judges of India. We attached great importance to the fact that a Commission of this kind must have men of the highest ability and integrity and we were fortunate in finding such a man in Mr. Varadachari. Anything entrusted to a Judge of that high standing with his life-long experience of the Bench is bound to be carried out in a judicial manner. The House can be sure of that. In fact possibly if delays have occurred as they have partly they are due to the fact that the Commission and the Chairman are anxious to preserve every type of judicial procedure and not to do anything which might even give any suspicion of hurrying through and not giving that opportunity which should be given. If the House could see the decisions that they have given they are tremendously long seventy eighty or a hundred pages. They have carefully given every opportunity and have come to certain decisions. Most of these decisions also I would like the House to remember are ultimately by consent. Now the difficulty in dealing with such matters through let us say the Income-tax Department which is the normal way of dealing with them has been that they cannot deal with them both judicially and at the same time informally. They have to be formal their rules govern them and the people concerned do not like that particular process; they do not welcome it they do not go there easily unless they are compelled by law to go there. They do come at least relatively with this reluctance to this Inquiry Commission because the Inquiry Commission can deal with them informally can come to deal with them informally can come to terms with them almost any terms that they consider just and proper which the Income-tax Department cannot easily do always in this manner.",
66: "At the outset I should like to state that we are not able to understand some of the secrets of the Railway Board and the policy which they are following. When I say secret I mean that they have got certain policies and methods which are not easily understandable by people like us. There is no proper organization through which the ordinary railway labourers and their associations could represent their grievances. The hon. Minister was pleased to say the other day that there is the Railwaymen’s Federation. But I must tell him that the practical difficulty of all the Unions in the Railways is that they are not able to push their case through the Railwaymen’s Federation. Another thing I would like to point out is that when representations are made to the hon. Railway Minister or the Railway Board in many cases we get a suitable reply and as far as I have seen we do get a suitable reply but that is all. I would request the hon. Minster to see that their cases are properly considered and something is done to them. The other day I represented to the hon. Minister and also the Railway Board the case of the sanitary inspectors. They are classified as supervisory staff. Prior to 3rd May 1948 they were given upper class passes like other officers but since that date all of a sudden the upper class passes have been stopped for these people. We do not understand why this discriminiation should have been made against these sanitary inspectors. I would request the hon. Minister to see that proper consideration is shown to them and to remove inconsistencies in this regard. Even though repeated representations have been made to the Railway Board and the hon. Minister the case of the running staff has never been properly considered at all. In the case of ‘B’ Grade firemen all of a sudden the literacy qualification was introduced and people who have passed the S.S.L.C. examination have been taken directly as firemen. But what about the case of those who entered service before this literacy question was introduced? Some of them have put in more than ten years of service. They were recruited by a staff selection board after proper examination. They were never required to pass the S.S.L.C. examination when they entered service. But suddenly this literacy qualification has been introduced and their chances of promotion have been reduced. The number of persons affected is very small and I would therefore request the hon. Minister to look into their case favourably. Another point is about telegraph inspectors. They are the people who look after the maintenance of telegraph lines. They have been recruited in the normal manner and they are the people who have put in service of more than ten or fifteen years. The question of wireless inspectors came in at the time of war. They are now classified along with telegraph inspectors. Whenever certain appointments or grades are introduced the case of the telegraph inspectors is overlooked. The wireless inspectors who are called communication inspectors at present came into the picture only at the time of war. Now what happens is that the telegraph inspectors who have put in a service of more than ten or fifteen years and who look after the work which was used to be done by the wireless inspectors are neglected and overlooked. I hope their cases will receive the deepest consideration of Government and a proper solution will be found. I now come to the grievances of travelling ticket examiners. Representations were made by them that they should be classified as running staff. They are not sitting staff. They have been representing that they should be classified as running staff along with drivers and fireman. Their cases have also been overlooked. It is a small case and the Railway Board can easily understand it if only they have a mind to look into the matter. There are ever so many things but I do not want to mention them all. I do not understand the secrets of the delay. According to the Railway Board delay means ten years. That is the minimum. I am not exaggerating. I shall give you an example. An estimate for constructing an overbridge was sanctioned ten years ago. Nobody came there. I requested the hon. Deputy Minister to visit that place. He was pleased to visit it. I must thank the hon. Deputy Minister on behalf of my constituency. What happens is that we cannot be taking the hon. Railway Minister or the hon. Deputy Minister to each and every place where a work has to be executed. This is another point which I want the Railway Ministry as well as the Railway Board to bear in mind. People are nowadays afraid of travelling in aeroplanes but I think that a reference to the volume of papers supplied to us will show that accidents to trains are increasing day by day.",
67: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir this year the President’s Address given to the Parliament gives a well conceived well-prepared picture of the nation. I rise to support the Motion of Thanks which has been brought before the House by Shri Kulkarni. At the outset he has pointed out that this year has faced a severe drought. Then he points out to the danger of internal and external forces that remind us of the secessionist tendencies the terrorism that is prevalent in a very serious form in the North-West and North-East frontiers of the country. This really requires attention of not only the Government but of all the people of all the political parties existing in different parts of the country. In his speed he has tried to remind us of the promises made in our Constitution. It is our sacred duty to see that those promises are fulfilled. He has said that the ideals of secularism and socialism are enshrined in our Constitution. These values have to be upheld and above all integration of the nation is also to be upheld. Sir it is time that we did not discuss matters out of emotion. When we speak emotionally we forget these high goals we forget reality and rationalism. Sometimes it is necessary to see that healthy criticism is there. It is required in a democracy to rectify mistakes of a Government. It is a welcome feature but when we speak emotionally we forget these fundamental facts and obviously we commit mistakes. Here we should remember that we are speaking in the highest supreme body of the nation where the future of the nation is to be built. When we are discussing all these things in this House about the development of the national life the whole world is watching us. So this factor has always to be kept in mind. Now coming to the second point about the external dangers we know of the terrorists in the border State. Sometimes they are assisted by certain outside powers who are not happy with our development. Sometimes they are provided with the latest weaponry with ulterior motives. These things have been discussed in the House and they need not be repeated here. But we cannot be blind to ourselves. We have to look to these aspects. Many of the hon. Members have made a mention of these things and we must be prepared for everything. Sometimes they are supplied with sophisticated weapons. Super-powers are helping them. So we must be careful and watchful. Another thing is about the secessionist tendencies supported under the cover of religious fundamentalism abetted by foreign agencies. This must be curbed. That is the greatest danger in our country today. Sometimes chauvinism regional and linguistic fervours create very dangerous tendencies and if we do not think of all these things these may come out as hydra-headed creatures in future and create many a splitting situation in the national picture for which we will be blamed in future. Whoever is in power. It is the responsibility of all citizens all political parties to look into these factors which have been rightly pointed out in the President’s Address. This year we have passed through the greatest drought of the century. Because India had achieved something in the Green revolution we could come out of it. Out of 35 climate zones suffered from scanty rainfall and drought and some parts of the country faced floods also. There was loss of crops and damage to crops. Production was much less. Because we had a buffer stock of 23 million tones which was sound planning and the Green Revolution had achieved something the country could face this difficult situation. At the same time many hon. Members have brought out in this House that the Kisans are unhappy. They are vibrating with new ideas new expressions of rising expectations. What are their problems? Anybody who goes to the villages comes to know that the balance of trade or the balance of economic situation is not in their favour. The prices are rising and they are not getting justice. That is their feeling. Still worse is the plight of small and marginal farmers. The Government is spending a lot on subsidies for food sufficiency by way of subsidized fertilisers and other things. But their share is much less. The dry land farmer and the small and marginal farmer have to do distress sales because in our country there is no proper marketing organization to help them. Unfortunately we had thought that the cooperatives would develop but they have not developed and the marketing agencies have not developed. So they are the worst sufferers in this situation of rising prices. The other sectors enjoy a favourable position; they can command the economy. The farmers are very much discontended for which we have to take proper precautions. That is what I want to submit through this hon. House to the Government.",
68: "Mr. Chairman I rise to support this Resolution because this matter has to be considered and reconsidered as planning goes on. Right at the beginning I must say that this village industry despite all brave talk on the part of the Planning Commission and the Government has been given a back seat by the Planning Commission and I think a lot has to be done in order to reorientate the entire approach with regard to village industries. I generally agree with much of what has been said by the two speakers who have preceded me and I should like to add a few suggestions to what they have said. Now even when we were fighting the British one of the indictments against the British rule was that it led to the ruination of our village and cottage industries. This criticism was absolutely justified and the meaning of it was not fully seen at that time perhaps as it is seen today after independence. We have embarked on a policy of industrialization of the country but in an underdeveloped economy like this where we have got nearly 82 per cent or a little more of the population living in the villages you cannot have rapid industrialization merely by starting heavy industries or even medium industries in the urban areas and towns whether they be in the public sector or in the private sector. They are of course important and the development of such industries must be on a far bigger scale. That is what we stand for but at the same time we must embark on a policy of industrialization of the rural areas today. There was a time when capitalist economists almost took it for granted that with the development of capitalism rural industries must go and in fact in Europe in the beginning of the 20th century we saw in Germany and other places many small-scale and village industries going out of existence as capitalism grew. Monopoly capitalism which is growing in our country also has a tendency to crush the small and medium industries let alone village industries. The moment rural economy is drawn into the orbit of capitalistic market the tendency is there and the laws operate for the decline of the rural industries of the type that exist. Now this process is there in our country artificially we are trying to maintain some. In the rural areas you have nearly 3.5 million new job-seekers every year. Rural industry must be viewed from the larger angle of industrialization of the country from the point of its employment potentialities and also from the point of view of raising the standard of living in the country. Yesterday here the Prime Minister was saying that unless agriculture looked up national income would not go up still higher and the standard of living would not go up. I entirely agree but then in the rural sector of our economy we must develop simultaneously the other sector that is called the rural industrial sector that for promoting rural industries on a larger scale. That is not being done. Now I found in our country and we heard complaints that these industries were not getting help. The artisans are not only not taken care of but they are sent to their doom by the Government in many places. I found that in the South also many fine handloom industries which should be nursed by the Government and developed with all the attention and care are allowed to go out of existence. Therefore it needs a serious re-thinking on the part of the Commission as to how can we set about this task. It is not just a question of supplementing something. It is a question of developing a dynamic sector in our economic life in the countryside because we cannot envisage a situation where industries will be developing only in the towns and the problem will be solved. Bigger industries and certain other medium industries will certainly develop and should develop in the towns. At the same time small industries through co-operatives State sector individual enterprise and through artisans should also develop in the countryside. This is how we can step up the rate of industrial progress of the country. These industries can cater to the consumers needs to a considerable extent relaxing our pressure on imports and also helping the development of certain vital industries apart from providing employment. The employment question is very important. Now at the time of the last general election the gentlemen of the Congress Party issued a manifesto written by Prime Minister Nehru in which they have said the unemployment would be reduced in the course of the next five years. At that time it was 53 lakhs. Now when they went to the third general elections the unemployment has gone up to 90 lakhs and we are told by the Planning commission that in the course of this Five Year Plan it would have gone up to 12 millions.",
69: "Mr. Deputy Chairman I thought I should rise to support the point put forward by the hon. Mr. Kunzru but my hon. friend from Hyderabad has said certain things which I had better deal with first. He has attacked more or less the whole system of elections in India. He has talked of indirect election and so on. I am afraid he has gone far beyond the scope of the Bill and I do not think that that needs an answer at all. As regards the question of preparing electoral rolls I think there is ample power vested in the Election Commission to order the preparation of a regular electoral roll if the Election Commission considers it necessary for any extraordinary reasons such as a large exodus from one place to another and things of that kind. Otherwise as the hon. Member himself said it is such a vast country and such huge numbers are involved that I think it would be really an unnecessary burden on the resources of the state to launch upon the preparation of electoral rolls every year. The same purpose could be served by revising the electoral rolls every year as per the directions given by the Election Commission as well as the rules laid down for the purpose. In a democracy one of the pre-requisites for its success is vigilance and I think it would be quite in order to expect the people of various parties to interest themselves in the revision of these electoral rolls. In fact that is an obligatory task of the citizens and it only helps to greater awareness and alertness on the part of the different parties. There was another point made by my hon. friend to which I should like to refer. He referred to false personation. I am not going to deny it absolutely. There might have been some false personation but to say that it was the Congress that resorted to false personation and that all other parties were paragons of virtue and were angels dropped from heaven is simply absurd. That he should have had the boldness to venture such a reckless statement- I should say irresponsible statement –without any proof whatever was wholly unfair on his part to the Congress and it has no credit to this August House that one of its members should make such an allegation against the Opposition parties. Sir my purpose is more to appreciate the stand taken by my hon. friend Shri Kunzru. I do not know it is for the hon. Minister to say whether even now as the clause stands it would not be open to the Election Commission to review the order of the Chief Electoral Officer made in appeal against an order of the Electoral Registration Officer. I have an idea that the Election Commission is supreme in these matters that even when there is an appeal from the Electoral Registration Officer to the Chief Electoral Officer and the Chief Electoral Officer passes an order though it may be final in the ordinary sense it does not preclude the Election commission from revising that order. I would like to be enlightened on this point. If the hon. Minister in charge of the Bill says that the order in appeal of the Chief Electoral Officer over an order of the Electoral Registration Officer is final and it is not open to the Election Commission to set it right then I beg humbly to differ from such a stand and I think that is lacuna which should be made up. So I would like the hon. Minister to apply his mind to this aspect and see that in no case the supreme authority of the Election Commission in this matter which is of vital importance is in the least abridged or curtailed. I think a slight amendment to clause 23 would set right the whole matter. There is only one other remark which I wish to make before conclude and that is with regard to clause 25 on page 8. It enjoins on every local authority an obligation to make available to the Electoral Registration Officer such staff as may be necessary for the performance of any duties in connection with the preparation and revision of electoral rolls. Well with the knowledge that we have of these local authority may fail to make available to the electoral registration officer the staff that he wants. Now what is the remedy if the local authority does not meet that obligation if it does not choose to make available the requisite staff? That has not been provided for in the Bill. It is open to the hon. Minister to devises some means to meet such a contingency but I think a clause like this would be very helpful. That will be some kind of an inducement to the local authority to provide the staff. That is all that I have got to say and I will no longer tire the House.",
70: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir I am obliged to the House for the general support this measure has received. I would like to clear up one or two points. I would begin by saying that this Act when it was passed and as it stands today on the statute book is intended only to regulate and control industries. Its purpose is not to take over the ownership of industries. For that we have got other measures and other methods to follow. The limited purpose here is this. Wherever industries appear to be going wrong and wherever because of the mismanagement or bad management public interest is affected or production has gone down in such cases there is provision for Government to take them over for a period and manage them. Now it has been found in many cases that we have taken over and managed them and managed them well. I would like to point out that there are many very good examples where industries which a little while ago were good down have prospered under Government management and control and in this period the Government has never used its power indiscriminately. In all these years twelve undertakings were taken over and then handed back. Seven undertakings are today under the management of the Government. One of the undertakings which is today under Government management and which has occasioned this measure was in a rather bad way when Government took it over about seven years ago and the Government within the initial five-year period of management improved its finances. Its profits have gone up. Its reserves have gone up. The concern has considerable improved but then it was again thought that it has to be continued under proper management and Government are of the opinion that this management has to continue. If the existing law remains as it is today there is no course open to the Government but to hand it back to the share holders. This is one of the reasons why this measure has been brought forward before this House because the law as it stands today does not permit more than one extension of such management. So I think that clears the point which was raised by some of my friends. There is nothing like unlimited extension. This Act is not meant for Government to virtually take over industries and continue indefinitely in control of them. I am in sympathy with some of the views expressed. It is true that we should take responsibilities which we should be able to discharge well and I think even the most critical Members will be satisfied that we have taken such responsibilities very selectively and discharged them well. It may be that there are certain concerns which were really beyond redemption. Yet we have been making a sort of effort and that effort is well worth it. Now take the case of India Electric Works. Even as a working concern it is still in bad shape. The Government were compelled to take it over because otherwise it had to close down and a large number of workers were to be thrown out of employment. That was one of the reasons why we took it over. But then we cannot go on taking indefinitely such responsibilities at the cost of the taxpayer’s money. There is a limit to it. And what is the limit to such cases? My only intention is that to the best of its capacity whatever is possible the Government should try to bring about improvements and this provision of one extension alone should not stand in the way. Therefore the amending Bill gives powers to the Government to extend control by periods of two years at a time but by not more than ten years in all after the expiry of the initial period of five years. In that period it is supposed that the concern would be set in order; that is the intention. I am sure that this amendment will be helpful both to the private industry as well as to whatever the Government does in such cases. It is desirable in every way. The hon. Member referred to various companies which were mismanaged. I know of many cases. But my own and the Government’s policy is that they should take responsibility in such matters after careful scrutiny and examination. And that meets the point raised by some other friends too. We should not take over such responsibilities indiscriminately. We are careful and once a responsibility is taken the intention is to perform it well. That is why it is not possible to take over many more concerns. Yet it may be desirable despite the limitations of the Government to take over the control and management of concerns in the country’s interests and where the public interest is involved the Government cannot simply plead that its hands are full. We cannot shirk that responsibility when public interest is involved. I can assure the House that we shall not hesitate to serve the public interest.",
71: "I may draw the attention of the House to a special feature of the Budget and it is this. With all the heavy expenditure on defence to the tune of 30 per cent the developmental activity has not been slowed down. Today we are spending about 19 per cent on the different development activities. But in this respect I would like to submit that the allocation for education in the Budget continues to be at 2 to 3 per cent. I think education is a very important subject as it affects the minds of our younger generation and it gives us the necessary technical personnel who are so to say the hands and feet of our development. What we find here is that instead of making an increase in this particular direction on education we are keeping it at the same level. I would submit that the Finance Minister should give his due consideration for increasing the budget on education. Now I turn to the performance and the working of the Ministries. I would like to say something first about the work that the Planning Commission is doing. Of course the Planning Commission is doing an excellent work. It is at present preparing the Twelfth Five Year Plan. Not only that it is preparing a perspective plan for a number of years. It is also giving a vision; it is also suggesting certain priorities in so far as the progress of our country is concerned. The Planning Commission is also carrying out different kinds of studies and researches. But at the same time what I feel is that the Commission must apply itself also to the weaker sections of the society namely the landless labourers the artisans and those who are living in the rural areas. It must also apply itself as to how the weaker areas or the underdeveloped areas in our country can be helped. I know that the Planning Commission has prepared certain indicators and has asked the State Governments to show which are the regions which are underdeveloped according to the indicators. But that much of attention will not do. We have to give more attention because if such areas continue so in the different States in our country it will hamper the general progress of the country. From the questions that are asked in this House the Minister will know the anxiety amongst the Members. So I would suggest for the consideration of the Minister that a special wing be established in the Planning Commission to study and prepare schemes for such regions. Today only seven States have informed as per indicators about these regions and even then I would submit that a special wing may be constituted in the Planning Commission to study and prepare schemes for such regions. This wing should not merely prepare schemes but it must at the same time also watch the implementation of the schemes that are meant for such regions. The Planning Commission must direct that a special provision be made and priority given to all the schemes for such regions. The economic development of such a region depends upon the building up of economic overheads in that particular region and you will find as I have given certain figures that in so far as Marathwada area is concerned there is lack of such economic overheads. Therefore industries are not coming up and since industries are not coming up other developments are also falling short. So I would request that consideration may be given to constituting a special wing in the Planning Commission for the underdeveloped areas. Coming to the Ministry of Education what I find is that the Ministry of Education has been going after too many things; it is going after too many changes and also too many experimentations. I think the time has come when we should stop this policy of going after too many changes and too many experimentations in the field of education. It is because of this that we have not been able to achieve after eighteen years of freedom a common pattern throughout the country. I think a plea has already been made by a lady Member about the pattern. Different patterns exist in different states of our country. One does not know what has happened to the educational objectives that have been incorporated in the different reports with regard to primary education secondary education and college education. Nobody has tried to peruse as to how far the educational objectives that have been incorporated in these reports have been put through in the different States. As far as I know basic education is not being worked in the spirit in which it ought to be and there are different misconceptions about it. So it should be seen by the Education Ministry that instead of going after too many changes and too many experimentations they concentrate and see that at least a common pattern of education at the primary level the secondary level and the college level is evolved throughout the country.",
72: "The President has said that in the last 60 years we have progressed along this path illumined by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. We shall adhere to it come what may with the determination and courage instilled in us by Sonia Gandhi. In my opinion this is the time for all of us whether belonging to that side or this side irrespective of party affiliations to rededicate ourselves to these basic fundamentals of our Constitution. If we do that we will be a united India. Not only will we command respect in the comity of nations but the foundations will be such that nobody on the earth will be able to do any harm to us. I have one thing to say that our country is a continent and in this continent we have faced this year one of the severest droughts in 100 years. It is the prudent policy of having accumulated buffer stocks that in spite of setbacks that we have experienced there has not been any starvation death. This is a tribute to the ingenuity of our policy of having created the buffer stocks. To my mind there are one or two grey areas. One of the grey areas is our population explosion which my friend Shri Prashant has also referred to. We may be doing what we are doing. For instance 20 million accepters of contraceptives and other things we have produced but we have not evolved a national consensus on this issue. I spoke about the matter in different forums when the Prime Minister was also there. I told him that a national consensus on family welfare programme must be evolved. I also told him that you have been calling meetings of the Opposition parties quite often on different issues but to my mind the most important issue for which an all party meeting should be convened is to evolve a national policy on population. In spite of our all round economic development it all gets nullified by the population explosion. We have not done much in this direction. I had the privilege of going to China and I saw how they are progressing in this regard. It is true that there have been many occasions when undue advantage has been taken by one party or the other in the implementation of this programme. That is why I want national consensus on family planning. Sir I go to the next area and that is with regard to agriculture. The Agriculture Minister has stated in a conference the other day that in spite of drought he has fixed a target of 175 million tonnes of foodgrains for the current year. That is a good idea. But the important thing to which the President has referred is the need of increase in the production of oilseeds and to this I add pulses. I want the Government to give special attention to the production of these things because edible oils and pulses are the common man’s need in India and we are having shortage of pulses and edible oils and we are importing these in a very large quantity. So the thrust of our programme as we have done in the case of Green Revolution is that we should concentrate on the production of pulses and edible oils and then assure our own people with within a period of two years we will attain self sufficiency in edible oils and pulses. The next point is with regard to public sector. There is no doubt that the public sector occupies a commanding height and it has occupied commanding heights in our mixed economy. But the problem of accountability of public sector has not been done to the desired extent. I submit Sir that for this purpose the Programme Implementation Ministry is helping the public sector undertakings with regard to any difficulties that they face. In that Ministry on or before 5th of every month they get a report from the particular undertaking with regard to the difficulties that they face in manufacturing or marketing or finance or any other thing and the programme implementation Ministry sees to it that these difficulties are removed. But a new thinking has come to the Heads of these public sector undertakings that is by sending the report on the 5th of every month they pass on the buck to the Programme Implementation Ministry and they forget about what they have written. This attitude has to be changed. The executives of these public sector undertakings should be told that the Planning Commission or the programme implementation Ministry is there only to help you and it is for you to set things right and see that any difficulties faced by them are removed and their undertaking shows results. I think for that purpose it will be advisable that their promotion or renewal of their contract or enhancement of their present grade should be linked with the jobs done by the heads of these public undertakings.",
73: "So far as the utility of the All India Services is concerned I would like to mention that first of all it will introduce an element of competition. There will be a wider field of selection there will be mobility from one State to another and from the States to the Centre and from the Centre to the States. These people will thus have a greater opportunity of gaining very rich experience which will be of great use not only to them but to the people with whom they have to work. I would also like to mention one more very important aspect that of national integration. The men of the All India Services by their experience in one State will be able to come closer to the people of the different States mix with them well and this will accelerate the process of national integration. This is not a small achievement through the Services. If the Services do not have this national approach then it is bound to have an adverse effect on the people as a whole because the services are in a way an element of the society and they are able to build up public opinion. I am not only talking of the officers at the top but at different levels and the kinds of opinion they hold the way they behave the way they act all have their own effect on the people. And if they function on a national basis in a disinterested way having no parochial views and consider matters at the national level then this will create a national atmosphere in the country. So it is very important that there should be as many All India Services as possible because as I said they are able to move about with every section of the people of the States know their language and they are able to bring fresh experience and fresh outlook in the different Sates wherever they go. Coming to the present two Services which are the subject matter of this Resolution the Agricultural Administration Committee which was set up in 2008 to examine the question of reorganization of agricultural administration recommended the formation of an All India Agricultural Service. Accordingly a scheme was drawn up by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and circulated to the State Governments on August 9 2012. So far as the question of All India Services is concerned it is this House that has the right to move and pass such a Resolution but because the States are also concerned naturally we consult the States. We take them into confidence we discuss with them and it is only after all the States have agreed that this question was finally decided and I was thought proper that these two All India Services should be formed. This does not mean that merely by the passing of this Resolution the Services are finalized. The terms and conditions the number of posts promotions and other details will have again to be brought before Parliament. As you know this Resolution only says that it is necessary and expedient in the national interest that Parliament should by law provide for the creation of these two Services. So this Resolution is only a preliminary step in a way. This is not a final step. Therefore I am not going to touch upon the details because the details are not necessary. But I will give broad outlines of these two Services. It is proposed that like the existing All India Services each State should have an Agriculture Service cadre of its own incorporating the posts of District Agricultural Officers and above. The Union Territories would have a separate cadre to meet their requirements. The requirements of the Centre would be met by drawing officers on tenure deputation from the state and Union Territories Cadres. So far as recruitment is concerned 33 per cent of the senior posts will be filled by promotion of officers of the State Agricultural Services while the remaining posts will be filled by the recruitment. /that means those who are alredy in position will be promoted while two-thirds of the total will be filled nu direct recruitment. There will be four categories of posts- Director of Agriculture Additional Directors Deputy Directors and Assistant Directors of Afreiculture. Therse are the Broad outlines: I am not going into the details. So far as the Educational Service is concerned it was at the National Intergration conference held from 20th seeptember to 1st October 1961 that viess were expressed strongly that for administratice purpose an all India sercice should be created in the field of education. It was not only at that conference but here also more than once several members had crought forwared resolution for this prupose. I remember one of our REVERED Members brought such a resolution very often such resolutions were brought foreward but it was not possible for us to get all the states together",
74: "If we look at the provision of the Constitution we will find that this Resolution is in pursuance of the provision in Article 312. According to sub-Article (2) of the same Article we have now the Indian Administrative Service and the Indian Police Service which according to the sub-Article are deemed to have been created by the Parliament. Earlier also we decided to create some other All India Services. The reasons for the creation of these Services have been given by the hon. Minister and I entirely agree to them. One other aspect of this question I want to place before this House and that is that the scale of pay and the prospects in the All-India Services will be better than those in the State Services that there will be a wider field of selection and that the conditions of service and the scale of pay will attract better persons. We know that quite a large number of our young men doctors engineers etc. are still outside the country. Though they are keen to come and serve the country the service conditions in the State Services are not such as to attract them. I hope and trust that our young engineers and others who are abroad will be attracted to come back to our country and serve it in view of the better prospects. I think that the object of creating an all-India Service is to supplement and not to supplant the State Services. I mean to say that there will still be the State Education Service although we are going to have an All India Education Service also. I know how the States are dealing with it. I know about the State of Uttar Pradesh. As far as education is concerned we have got a State Education Service and also a Subordinate Education Service. In the State Service there is Class I and Class II. There is no direct recruitment to Class I services generally. Therefore when we are going to create an all-India Service I think the first question which will come up before the Government will be as to which of the personnel of the State Services are fit enough to be absorbed in the all –India Service. I find that the hon. Minister had suggested that there might be a proportion of 33 percent reserved for promotion. After this Resolution is passed by this House the Government will consider the question of legislation for the creation of these Services. I read the provision in Article 312 and I know that the creation of these Services is possible only by a law that we have got to bring forward a Bill and pass it into law. But as far as the conditions of service and all other things are concerned they are also to be regulated by Parliament. Therefore my suggestion is that these things should be determined by rules made under the proposed Act and the authority to make the rules should be delegated to the Government in that respect so that after everything has been gone into a proper decision is made both in regard to the conditions of service and also the proportion for recruitment for direct recruitment and by promotion. I have seen executive officers working in the States drawn both from the I.A.S. and the Provincial Executive Service. Normally I.A.S. officers are deputed to the States and during their posting they are under the control of the States; they are posted according to the recruitment of the State. I think the same principle will be followed in regard to these all- India Services also. But it will be desirable that officers serving in one State should not be allowed to remain there for a very long period; they should be taken back from the State and given to another State or they may be allowed to work in the Centre. But as far as the administrative control of these officers is concerned that will be with the States. But at the same time because they are all-India officers all disciplinary proceedings and action taken in consequence thereof is to be taken by the Central Government in consultation with the Union Public Service Commission. There is one thing more and that is this. Although these officers will be serving in the States and will really to a certain extent replace the present State officers still I feel that additional expenditure on administration will be necessary. To think that it will not involve any additional expenditure is I think not a correct notion. The finances of the States being what they are – all the elastic resources are with us at the Centre – it is not possible for the States to bear any further burden. If any additional expenditure is involved in the creation of these services that burden must be borne by the Centre and not transferred to the States because this expenditure is on Central Services.",
75: "First of all I would like to say that I have been an admirer of the Indian Railways for its critical support to the life and living of the people in the country. Secondly it has had an impressive record on several counts in recent years. Railways carry as freight items like processed minerals foodgrains etc. It has manufacturing as well as repair and maintenance units. It has also very good organisations like the rites and the ircon which have done extremely well in terms of operating results. In this connection let me compliment the hon. Minister for his very bold confession on the day he took charge that he was taking charge of the railways in a very good condition. Mr. Vice-Chairman we know that the hon. Railway Minister was a very eminent trade union leader. Particularly he was a union leader in the railway industry itself. Perhaps this switch-over to the other side of the fence though agonising is a challenge to him and I am sure he is getting the feel of the challenge and measuring up to it. The performance of the Railways during the Eleventh Five- Year Plan has been really impressive. It has generated Rs. 527 crores of surplus reduced the deferred dividend and it has reduced its dependence on the General Budget. It is of the order of only 41 per cent now. It has also successfully resorted to the instruments of internal resource generation and external resource mobilisation from the market. Modernisation of workshops renewal of tracks and coaches as well as rolling stock have been high on the agenda and most of these have been met with a general degree of satisfaction. Computerisation of passenger services has been a very welcome thing and a large part of the general public is enjoying its fruits. I do realise the problem of resources and the other kinds of things which the hon. Minister had raised for example how it is going to effect the job prospects etc. But Sir the fact remains that the Railways have to earn the confidence and the support of the commercial clients. The commercial clients depend primarily on the quality of freight service offered by the Railways. As far as the freight service is concerned Railways have a commercial problem. They are competing with the truck industry. The railway freight service is mainly dependent on the quality of service provided by the Railways the cost and the time involved in that context. Of course we realise that the truck industry is energy-deficient and it is very costly. But in the final analysis it is the consumer who has to bear the cost. The business and industry could care less whether the goods are carried by a cheaper mode of transport like the railways or a costlier mode namely by trucks. However in this the economy as a whole gets hurt. Particularly the Railways are likely to lose in terms of the freight traffic offered. I see a reference made in the hon. Minister’s statement in regard to the thrust in the next Plan. We realise that it would require more resources and more than that much more efficient management and support from the entire group of railway employees at all levels. It is important that Railway employees should be enthusiastic and involved and one does not get their involvement by simply exhorting them wishing them to do a better job but through suitable instruments of management. Certainly railways require much more capable leadership at all levels. We have a very dynamic Railway Minister. I have respect for individual members of the senior railway staff. Some of them are my friends and some of them I know at a personal level but in a competitive world you have not only to do a good job but continue to do it all the more in an improved way. Now there are three aspects in the railway development programme. As a passenger we are interested in the new railway lines. Not only that. We are also interested to see that the railways promote the infrastructure to support development potential growth for the depressed areas. Laying of the new lines is very critical but more than the productivity of the current assets of the Railways is also one of the critical determinants of the final efficiency of the railway system. Now with regard to the new railway lines I would like particularly to refer to the eastern region. Historically railway lines were laid in the coal belt and some other areas primarily to provide links and support to the extractive industry. We wanted all minerals from the pitheads to be carried to the points where they were used particularly for the new industrial centres. Coal iron ore iron and steel remain even today one of the dominant segments of freight carriage. So the density of railway lines in these two regions particularly Bihar and West Bengal has a historical origin. But if you look at the post-independent India the per capita increase of railway track in that region has not been improved.",

77: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir the Compulsory Deposit Scheme which was introduced in 1974 was partially withdrawn in 2007 for the lower income group and it has continued for income groups having an income of Rs. 1500000 and above per year. Sir the objective of the Bill is laudable— as being anti-inflationary and to save what is called conspicuous consumption. But is the Government really serious about the whole matter? Sir it has been reported in the press that the Government wants to impound 50 per cent of the dearness allowance due to the Central Government employees. Why has this dearness allowance become due? It became due from the month of March and May this year because the average 12 monthly index crossed 400 and 408 respectively. Not only that. Last month a third instalment has become due because the industrial consumer price index has gone up to 453. All this is because the Government’s policy about controlling the prices has been a complete failure. Without controlling the price line the Government will not be able to achieve anything. It will help neither the country nor the poorer sections of the people. I think this Government has not decided what should be its price policy. The price policy has to be integrated with the policy relating to income and wages and unless this policy is settled by the Government it is no use having only the Compulsory Deposit Scheme against those who are regular monthly salaried workers or those of higher income groups. But even though they may be of higher income groups with the high escalation of costs and the index going up so steeply their purchasing power is already eroded. Therefore I would like to know from the Government what steps it is going to take for the stabilisation of cost of living which has to be the main objective of any economic policy. Sir stabilisation of cost of living has been given a go-by. Nothing has been done to control the prices. On the other hand black market and a parallel economy are flourishing. Prices of ordinary vegetables like the cauliflower are Rs.25 per kilo and tomatoes are selling at Rs.28 per kilo. Everything has become so costly. Still the Government wants to attack those people who are only wage-earners and whose incomes are fixed. There is a fear that with the financial accounting year coming to a close the bonus question will come up and this Government which has no other policy except to fleece the workers and its employees will come forward with a sort of an Ordinance or a Bill by which they will deprive the workers of their bonus or they may ask them to deposit it with the Government. As I said earlier this Government must decide about its policy. The Government must come out with decision to have a national pay policy for all the Government servants including those of the State Governments and therefore it is very essential that a National Pay Commission should be appointed to decide the policy so that the working classes and employees can cooperate in the economic development of the country. I find that the Government is not taking any steps to prevent black-marketing or to run the public distribution system effectively. Hardly 4 lakh public distribution shops have been opened. As against the total population and the working class population it is a very meagre number. Therefore the worst affected persons due to the rising prices are the poor people the toiling masses and the entire working class. Therefore Sir my submission is that instead of continuing such schemes and having only piecemeal legislations will the Government decide a price policy for stabilisation of the cost of living which is very essential to have more economic development and prosperity? If they really want the employees to be partners in industry the Government must accept in principle that the fruits of prosperity must be shared by the working classes and therefore the time has come when participation of labour in management has got great importance. Otherwise we are caught in such a vicious circle that no progress can be made. What is happening now is the rich are becoming richer and all the black marketers are having a field day. We have heard of the prices of land in Bombay and other things and how everything is being exploited by the big businessmen smugglers and others who are having a field day in the country. Therefore I am opposed to this type of ordinances. Sir the Government has adopted a novel method for solving the economic problems of our country. When the budget was presented they did not spell out the terms. In fact a Bill with the necessary fiscal measures should have been thought of when he budget was presented but in the Budget Session nothing was done. Recently the prices of petrol and other petroleum products were increased without any indication in the budget.",
78: "Madam Vice-Chairman yesterday the hon. Minister made a very strong case for his Resolution. He stressed the necessity for an integrated approach to these problems. He appealed in the name of national integration to accept this proposal. He also stressed the necessity of having emotional integration through this measure. Well I am not against having an integrated approach as far as both education and agriculture are concerned. But my fear is whether this step in the present context will at all help the integrated approach which he wants and the national integration which he is aspiring for. Now I will concentrate more on the educational service. I was thinking about this problem after I heard the hon. Minister yesterday with my state in my mind. Our State is considered to be one of those which are so far ahead in education. But unfortunately the situation there is not very happy. Coming to college education in our State there are a large number of private colleges. There are a number of Government colleges and there are a few colleges directly under the University. Now those college teachers who are directly under the University are concerned to be the blessed few because they have a higher salary fewer hours of work and sometimes the number of students whom they have to teach happens to be very limited whereas teachers with the same qualification employed in Government colleges have to work 18 hours or even more and they get a meagre salary. The creation of these University teachers instead of helping to integrate is causing so much of discontent among the Government college teachers. Now this creation of all-India Education Service will create another few persons who may be much better placed than either the University teacher or the Government college teachers. This state of affairs I am afraid will create more confusion rather than help integration. Now as I mentioned earlier there is a third category of private college teachers. Their condition is not very much better than that of high school teachers. In some cases their condition is worse. The pay they used to get was too low that whenever they got a better chance elsewhere they used to leave these colleges and go. The result of this state of affairs on the education in the colleges is that their standards are very low throughout the whole country. So when I think of the integration of education in my State leaving aside the other parts of India I feel much more than introducing this all-India Service some other things have to be done in our State to remove this anomally and I feel that as far as college education is concerned whether it be in the private sector or in the public sector wherever it is the Government have to take the responsibility for college education. The pay and other things have to be almost similar as far as these private colleges Government colleges and the University colleges are concerned. Unless that is done you will not be able to integrate the educational system inside our State itself. In the final analysis the result of the present state of affairs falls on the standard of the students. At one time the colleges in the South especially Tamil Nadu and Kerala boasted themselves of having a higher standard compared to the colleges elsewhere. Now the position is entirely different. I am not speaking about Tamil Nadu. As far as my State is concerned the standard has fallen very low and the students coming from our colleges find it very difficult to get admission in other places. Secondly speaking about technical education our State though rather high as far as literacy is concerned in the matter of technical education is lagging far behind. A few institutions in the private sector engineering colleges and medical colleges are now permitted. But there also because of so many factors the standards are very low and the Government have to do something by which at least the technical education is immediately taken over by the Government. So to have an engineering college without the necessary appliances to teach is not only harmful to the students but it is harmful to the State itself. So also regarding the medical colleges. These are the things on which I would like the Government to pay primary attention and then we can think of the all-India Services etc. There is another anomaly. The students passing from our high schools cannot get admission in the colleges outside our State because the entire system is different. Last year there was a lot of difficulty. Nearly 2000 students expected admission in the Mysore University. Finally when they found that it was difficult because of the difference in the syllabus and all that. So some uniformity has to be brought in. That can be done only by making education a concurrent subject. The Government should take all necessary steps to see that you have a uniform system of education.",
79: "Sir I am a great believer in the public sector and I have often said in this House that public ownership can take many forms that it is not necessary for us to think in the old terms of complete nationalisation. The British Labour Party has on this question done a great deal of hard thinking I would therefore say that it is a little disappointing to find that the returns from our public sector concerns are on the low side. Actually I do not think that the public sector concerns should be condemned for that reason; they are new to their jobs. What about the returns that the private sector concerns give in the first few years of their existence? But we should have a high standard of efficiency in our public sector concerns and we should make them yield good returns. If that is done it will be possible for us also to reduce the burden of taxation of all classes of the community. I do not say that the public sector concerns should be run from a commercial point of view only. Profit is one of the things they are meant to yield. I would in this connection say that I would like our employees I mean the poorer classes of our employees to be associated in some way with the management of our public sector concerns. So far as our private sector undertakings are concerned I have been thinking in terms of co-ownership. I think I said this last year and perhaps I am repeating it again. I think our employees should be made or rather they should be regarded or should be given the status of shareholders and they should have a voice in the management of the concerns they are running. They should have a voice in selecting the directors who shall run the concerns for the country. They should have the opportunity to rise to positions of managerial importance in the concerns with which they are connected. I think it is in some such way that we shall avoid the evils of what may be called bureaucratic socialism and give content to the shape of socialism which gives initiative which gives opportunity and which gives a sense of importance and dignity to the common man. Therefore our effort should be an eliminate gradually the distinction between the employee and the employer. My point of view and the point of view of the hon. Member are so different that we can only meet socially outside. Now Mr. Vice-Chairman much has been said about foreign capital and foreign technical aid. There are people who are opposed to the employment of foreign capital at all. But no country has been able to do so. We should however be able to employ foreign capital without strings attached to them as we are doing today. So far as foreign technical aid is concerned we cannot dispense with it. I would like to say that there is a tendency in our country to be content with the second best or the third best. I think that is an unfortunate tendency. We have in the world of technology and in the world of Science a great deal to learn from foreign countries. We have to learn a great deal from the United States of America and Russia and also from France and other countries and we should be humble in our approach towards this problem. We should be prepared to give to our managerial staff opportunities of acquiring technical knowledge and technical skill in these countries. I will finish in less than a minute. There is this question which has assumed great importance namely the question of price control. I know this subject raises some difficult questions. We have to consider the position of the farmer who has been exploited for ages by the people of the cities. But we have also to think of our people of the cities all of whom are not rich. Many of them have to lead very humble lives and the rise in prices the rise in the cost of living particularly in urban areas is becoming very high. It is therefore necessary for us to have some system of price control. We should have a price stabilisation board which should be able to regulate prices in such a manner that they are fair to the farmer and they are also fair to the consumer in the towns. We should eliminate as far as possible the middleman. Then I should like to say that I am glad that the Finance Minister has given up deficit financing. But the question which arises is how we shall finance our Twelfth Five Year Plan. Methods must be discovered which would enable the financing of the Twelfth Five Year Plan in such a manner as to provide the greatest possible employment to our people. We must attach importance not only to our basic industries and to our heavy industries but others also.",
80: "Mr. Vice-Chairman this Finance Bill has been introduced at a time of crisis at a time of external crises. In addition to the Chinese on the north we have incursions from the neighbouring country on the west. Therefore it seems to me that this Finance Bill and the Budget proposals should be defence-oriented but we find no provision for increase in Defence expenditure. It is still Rs.740 crores as it was at the time when the Finance Minister announced his proposals. If we are to put our Defence in proper order so as to ensure the security of our country if we are not to look for military alliances in order to supplement our Defence Forces our Defence expenditure must be increased considerably and it will have to be Rs. 800 crores 900 crores or even a thousand crores of rupees. There is enough money in this Budget to allow transfer of more to the Defence services. Money has to be found by reducing expenditure on other items which absorb so much money. The expenditure on the plan is 200 crores of rupees on the Revenue account and another three hundred crores on the Capital account. This must be drastically pruned. The plan expenditure must be reduced to indispensable expenditure expenditure which may be required for the development of the country like agricultural improvements and all facilities and aids that agriculture requires like village roads minor irrigation reclamation of land anti-erosion projects literacy without which our agriculturists cannot increase their productivity technical education which will also improve the productivity technical education which will also improve the productivity of not only the agriculturists but also those engaged in the industrial sector. There is certain expenditure which is unjustifiable in the present circumstances in the present crisis situation in which we are placed. There is the expenditure on the Planning Commission. Cannot we really have a less expensive Planning Commission than the one which we have and which costs about one crore of rupees a year? The National Economic Development Council of England costs only twenty lakhs of rupees two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling and it does as good work as if not better than our Planning Commission to increase the productivity of England. There is also that absolutely unjustifiable item of Family Planning. I believe that in the Fourth Plan it will be raised to 70 crores. Then what about the expenditure on our administrative services? It has been growing steadily. We must have a Commission on the pattern of the Hoover Commission which proposed a reduction of 7000 million dollars in the administrative expenditure Budget of United States of America. We must have a commission on that pattern in order to go into the whole business of our administrative system from top to bottom from the Centre down on the States in order to modernise it. We have been promised administrative reform committees in the secretariat. The Home Minister makes much of these administrative reforms committees. First of all their objective is only to reduce the delay in the Secretariat not to reduce the expenditure. And moreover appointment of administrative reforms committees from among the Secretariat officers is like asking the patients in a hospital to prescribe for one another. You must have an outside body a scientific body of administrators composed of public men and of businessmen such as the Hoover Commission was in order to go into the whole business of the costly administrative system under which the country is suffering. Then in regard to our Defence organisation also are we getting the best out of the money that we are spending even out of the Rs.740 crores that we can afford? What we want for the defence of our frontiers is a mobile force not the kind of force suggested by somebody in the other House the other day. They wanted the frontier to be defended by the whole army; they wanted the whole army to be deployed all along the frontier. We want mobile force well armed well equipped which will be able to rush to danger spots before these danger spots become more dangerous. The Government has suggested that a police force would be enough to do the ordinary work of defending our frontiers. I hope it will be an armed police something like the armed reserve police used in Madras now generally for suppressing the student riots. It might be better used in the ordinary day to day defence our Pakistan border. Has the Army got all the modern equipment that is required? Have we got enough machine guns automatic rifles mortars and grenades and how many per unit? Have we enough small and medium tanks? Have we enough anti-aircraft guns and have we enough helicopters which are in evidence in the recent defence action against the Pakistan incursions? Have we got the new craft which does not rise above a few yards but which would be very useful in desert areas?",
81: "Mid-term elections were held in Kerala as the House knows on the 4th March 2005 because we did not want that the President’s Rule should continue further and that a democratic set-up with a State Legislature should be there in Kerala so that the people of Kerala themselves can again have their own Legislature. As the House knows according to the results announced no Party secured an absolute majority by itself and no Party was in a position to form a Government. Out of 133 the Party which had the majority votes was the Left Communists numbering 40. The next Party having the greatest number was Congress with 36. The third was Kerala Congress with 23. Now out of a total number of 133 the Left Communists had only 40 seats out of whom 29 were at that time under detention. We therefore explored all avenues likely to lead to the formation of a stable government. The Governor had been in touch with the various Party leaders. From March 8 to March 16 he held detailed consultations with the leaders of the Communist Party the Indian National Congress the Kerala Congress the SSP and the Muslim League. The Governor did not seek the views of the Right Communist Party of India as they had secured only three seats out of a total of 133. The position that emerged from these consultations briefly was that although it was possible for him to negotiate with the various groups and individual legislators and evolve the basis on which a non-Congress Government could be formed the leaders of Kerala Congress and Muslim League made it clear to the Governor that they would not join or support any Ministry that might be formed or sponsored by the Communists. The two major parties Kerala congress and Muslim League said they would neither support nor join the Communist Government. Therefore they could not work with the support of these two. So far as the Congress was concerned its attitude was that it would act as a constitutional Opposition to whatever Government might be formed supporting it only to the extent that its policies were in line with those of the Congress but not otherwise. Therefore that Ministry could not expect support from the Congress Party. Thus what happened was that expect for the SSP which was not opposed to a Ministry formed or sponsored by the Communists the other Parties were clear that they would neither lend their support to nor seek the support of the Party in forming a Government. In these circumstances the Governor found no possibility of the Communist Party commanding a working majority even if those of their members who were under detention were allowed to function. Then also expect the S.S.P. there was nobody else to support them. The Governor did not therefore call upon the leader of that Party to form a Government. The Governor also explored other possibilities. The decision of the Congress Party was not to join with any other Party otherwise Kerala Congress and Congress combined might have had 59 plus some others if they could. In view of the decision of the Congress Party not to join with any other Party to form a Government and the combined strength of the Kerala Congress Muslim League etc. being only 37 the Governor came to the conclusion that there was no possibility also of any other Party being able to form a combination with other Parties and being able to form a Ministry. The attitude of the Congress was that once having gone to the electorate and the electorate having given a decision that they were not to elect them in a majority they did not want to form a Ministry with any other Party but would rather like to act as a constitutional opposition. That was the stand taken. Therefore there was no likelihood of any combination by any method whatsoever to have any Party which could have a working majority. Accordingly in his report dated March 8 2005 the Governor stated that it was not possible for a representative Government to come into existence as a result of the elections to the State Assembly and recommended to the President to issue a Proclamation under Article 356 of the Constitution. After a careful consideration of all the facts it was decided that the Vice-President discharging the functions of the President should be advised to revoke the Proclamation dated September 10 2004 and issue a fresh Proclamation assuming to the President all functions of the Government of Kerala and all powers vested in or exercisable by the Governor of the State. Accordingly the Proclamation was issued on the 24th March 2005 and a copy of this Proclamation was laid on the Table of the House.",
82: "Madam the unemployment question is a very vital question in the country and though the Government has been telling us what steps and measures are being taken yet unemployment is increasing year after year. In the rural areas unemployment and under-employment both are there. In the urban areas those who get only some education do not get any employment. But in the rural areas this is a chronic disease. I am stressing on the agricultural labour. While giving his views on some of the points in the general discussion on the Budget our esteemed friend Shri Khandubhai Desai stressed upon agricultural labour. It is a very chronic problem. Agricultural labour forms a very vital part of our rural population. They have no land and those who have land employ the labour to their advantage. Agricultural labour is such that for employment it always depends upon other people. When the labourers get some employment on big farms they get some job for their livelihood. But for all the year they are not getting employment though the Government is proclaiming so many land reforms land ceiling and so many things as being introduced. But everywhere you find a large number of village population. They have to run from place to place. Some hon. members complained that they are coming to towns and cities to create problems. If they do not come to towns where should they go? Unless they are employed unless they are economically settled they have to find some employment somewhere for themselves. So they are running from place to place. I know about my own State. From my neighbouring State people are running there. Some get employment a tea garden labour some in road works some as rickshaw pullers. There people are running from place to place but proper employment is not there if this chronic disease is not manfully taken care of by the Government boldly taken care of by the Government if concrete schemes are not put up and if people are not employed in them we cannot boast of our democracy we cannot say that we are doing so many things for creating employment. You know that there is the question of rural electrification. But what is being done? Here our Minister was telling about 45 pilot projects that are there but what are they for this vast country? What can we done by these projects? The Planning Commission is doing many things. There are many plans but how far are they being achieved how far are they being implemented how far has unemployment problem beer solved? These are to be seen. Forty-Five projects will not do to serve the vast population of this country. It is a gigantic problem. So my submission is unless you take concrete steps and devise concrete schemes to develop industries in the rural areas things will not improve. Madam you were pleased to intimate in this connection that the Khadi and Village Industries Board is doing something. But what do they do? They have asked the States to survey the areas and find out the industries that can be taken up. I know about my own State. There also the Khadi and Village Industries Commission have taken up small industries but it is not enough. It is a drop in the ocean. They select a few industries but there are potentialities and there is scope for developing small industries village industries in the rural areas but sufficient attention is not given by the Government to solve that problem. That is my humble opinion. Unless the Government has taken concrete measures to solve this acute problem no people in the rural areas can always remain asking Government or those who have ways and means to give them employment. This cannot do. So small industries village industries should be surveyed organised and developed. This problem cannot be neglected any further. Our late Prime Minister was telling us that unless you develop cottage and small industries and generate power in the rural areas this acute problem cannot be solved. I know about the intention of the Government. The Minister was telling that the Planning Commission have schemes and also a Committee but what efforts have been made? We must know the result. Though there are schemes and plans implementation is not there. People are not getting the benefits. There are many agricultural products which can be organised and developed as small industries. There is food processing. From earth you can get other things. Gur industry is there. There are hundreds of things you can do. In the British times we made a survey of some areas and we saw that there were many potential things in the villages. The villagers also know these. They are able-bodied men but because they are not properly organised of given employment they are nowhere. So my request to the Government is this. The pilot schemes etc. will not do. What we want from the Government is that they should face the problem with boldness and courage.",
83: "Sir we in Parliament are being asked to endorse the Proclamation. At the same time we have not been furnished with the report which the Governor had sent to the President. Now how can we give our verdict on a matter of such importance until and unless all the material facts warranting the Proclamation under Article 356 of the Constitution are place before us? Yesterday the hon. the Home Minister said that this report contained only certain facts and figures with regard to the party positions in the dissolved Andhra assembly. In that case what is the objection to placing that report before us? It would not give us anything particularly new except certain arrangement of figures made by the Governor of Andhra with a view to advising the President as to the course he should take. We submit that his report contains something else. It was the duty of the Government to place the entire report before us for the closest possible scrutiny and the most meticulous examination by Members of this House and of the other House because this report lies at the bottom of the whole thing as far as the constitutionality of the action of the President is concerned. Therefore I submit that a flat of the executive is sought to be endorsed by Parliament without telling us the grounds on which the flat had been exercised. Constitutionally this is improper. Then Sir the President also says that he had considered other information received by him. We have not been told yet as to what was this other information; neither have we been told about the source of such information. I do not know exactly on what basis the President applied his mind to the subject. We know that we cannot make any reflection on the President. He is a very wise man and wiser still by virtue of the occupation of the Presidency but I think we can call in question whether his mind had been rightly applied in a matter of such great importance and national concern. Our contention is that the President has not been in a position to apply his mind fairly and squarely to this subject because the report which had been submitted to him had been perverse distorted and false. Our contention also is that the other reports which had been submitted to him are not fully objective and truthful. This we are in a position to say all the more because if the case for the Government was so foolproof Dr. Katju would have been the last person to withhold his report from us. I think that something is wrong in the reports and maybe the Members of this House having looked at the reports would have discovered certain facts which do not go to justify the case that the Government has sought to make out in support of the Proclamation. Apprehending such a possibility I think Dr. Katju has thought it wise to withhold this report from the House. Having done it he asks us to endorse almost blind-fold a measure which is described as undemocratic even by certain members of the Congress Party. Many constitutional points have been touched. It has been sought to be made out in this House that this is the best democratic step that the Government could take. We say this is not at all a democratic step which has been taken. We are supposed to have a parliamentary system. We must have our own conventions. We have got our own Constitution but we are told time and again in this House and in the other House that there are the British Constitution and their Parliamentary practice which one should imitate. Now imagine a situation of this sort in England. Would the Crown have taken such a measure at all if a certain party had been voted out of office by the Opposition? I think in a comparable situation there the King would have inevitably called the Leader of the Opposition to explore the possibilities of forming a Government. Without doing it he would have never taken recourse to extraordinary measures like this. If this method had been resorted to in the United Kingdom a serious constitutional crisis affecting not merely the internal politics of the Parliament but the political life outside would have ensued. In France for instance there are many parties. No party by itself enjoys an absolute or a comfortable majority. What happens there? Ministry is formed and there we find the President takes upon himself the responsibility of exploring ways and means of finding whether any particular party or any leader of any party is in a position to present a government which would command the confidence of a certain majority in the Chamber of Deputies. Without resorting to that objective test he does not take recourse to extraordinary measures. In the present case I say this objective test has not been at all applied. One may or may not have certain feelings.",
84: "I am glad that the Government is thinking in terms of the small growers. By all means give them representation but let not an attempt be made as though the bigger growers are not looking after the interests of the small growers because that is far from the truth. If the Coffee Board has achieved one grand result it is to rehabilitate and help the small growers. So far as the question of payment from the pool is concerned the small grower gets the full amount due according to the costing the moment he delivers the coffee. There is a separate method of costing and the whole amount is paid immediately whereas in the case of the bigger growers it is not so. Payments are made as and when coffee is sold in the market and abroad. Supposing this aid was not there for the small grower what would have happened? He would have had to make distress sales he would have had to take whatever the market was able to offer and he would not have had the benefit of export prices which rule as much as 100 per cent over and above the home prices. The price of coffee abroad is twice as much as it is in India. The small grower would not have had the ghost of a chance of getting higher prices by the sale of coffee to foreign countries. Not only that; he also gets his basic price immediately on delivery of the coffee to the pool. Over and above all this he gets the benefit of all the scientific research which he would not have otherwise got. He gets all the aid from the bigger growers because as my hon. friend said yesterday it is to the advantage of the bigger planters to help the smaller ones. There is a disease which is communicable and which can destroy the neighbouring estates. So in these multifarious ways the small growers are today helped and they are immensely thankful to the bigger growers and to the Coffee Board. Now a special plea is sought to be entered on behalf of the small growers. What I say is that we can have representation for small growers on the Board; that is perfectly right but let there be no suggestion whatever to the effect that the cause of the small growers was neglected. That is not correct. As regards financial aid that is a State problem; that is a Union problem and that is a problem for the whole of the country in respect of all developmental activities. One thing I must say and that is that there are obvious limitations for the small growers. The acreage is limited and they cannot spread beyond that; they have got their paddy fields and their plantain gardens and so due to limitations they cannot spread over. Any development of coffee means a large acreage and that is not available to small growers. Even if they have got the capacity it is very difficult for them to find forest lands nearby. It is not easily possible for any man to go over fifty miles and then take up a jungle. So the small growers have their own limitation. I am not going into that but what I do say is that this idea introduced for the first time here in the Parliament that the interests of the small growers have got to be specially protected is I submit a policy which will create a difference between the bigger grower and the small grower. I submit that there is no reason whatsoever to distrust the plantation industry and deny them the right to select their own representatives and to introduce the word ‘nomination’ here. Why should we have nomination? If there is need for separate representation for the small growers why should we not reserve a seat in each place for the small grower? That is the easiest and the best way to give representation to the small growers. This can easily be done and therefore I submit that the words ‘or nominated’ may kindly be deleted from the Bill. I do not know whether the procedure would permit of it because there are certain difficulties but in any case if at least we get an assurance from my fiend that these twelve are going to be elected it would be something gained for a poor like me and for the industry. After the question of constitution of the Board comes the question about the Chairman. On that question I hope sir that the House will kindly appreciate that for more than one reason it would not be the best arrangement to have a wholetime appointed Chairman. There are two suggestions in this connection. My hon. friend’s suggestion is that it must be an elected office as hitherto; he has also said that out of the thirteen years only for 1.5 years has there been a planter as Chairman otherwise the post was always held by an officer.",
85: "I am dealing with the question of the powers of the Government to stop such films. The Government has been complaining that they have not got the powers. My point is that the power is there and if this power is exercised fully and properly there need be no Resolution like this because the whole purpose of the Resolution is that the moral standards of the country should not go down. Sir in this connection all that the Government can do is to cut out the objectionable part of the pictures. They cannot force the producers to produce a particular type of picture. It is only in those countries where it is undertaken by the Government that it may be possible that the Government may produce pictures of the type which the hon. Members might approve. It is picture which they think is a best entertainer as well as good instructor. But you cannot force and the Government has no power and the Government will never have the power or the House can never give the Government the power to force the producer to produce a particular type of picture. It is only a Government undertaking that could do that. But in this connection I do wish to emphasise one point that these pictures objectionable or not objectionable should not be open to boys under a particular age. If you are convinced that these pictures are likely to have a baneful influence you must stop them but at the same time we must have pictures for children. We all know that Russia Slovakia Poland and other totalitarian countries are having excellent children’s pictures but we must not forget that these children’s pictures are produced by the Government. There is a double purpose in producing these pictures. It is not only to give instruction and entertainment to children but there is a particular type of education which they want to give to the children and particular ideas which they want to put into the heads of the children and so it is undertaken by the Government. It is not at all an economic proposition. Even in America they have produced only very few films and even those that they have produced for children are such that they are very good entertainers even for adults. The only other country is the United Kingdom which has made an attempt in this direction through private enterprise but there are philanthropists who have devoted themselves exclusively for this purpose who without desiring any profits for themselves have been prepared to undergo any loss and it is only through those people in U.k. that they could produce really marvelous pictures for children. Here in India we can never expect any good children’s picture to be produced by the private producer. I know that the Government of India has even set apart an award for it but that award will be of no avail. It is only deceiving ourselves and the Government is deceiving itself if it expects that simply because of this award any producer will undertake producing a good children’s pictures because it is an absolutely uneconomic proposition and it cannot be done and the Government must take the responsibility upon itself. The Information Department in its Films Division should produce goo children’s pictures and those pictures should not only be preaching morals but they should be good entertainers and only if we could do that can we give something to the children which would be more attractive and where they will be more interested and along with the entertainments and interest they could get instructions even without being told that these are meant for education. Then and then alone we can have some good results and we can save our children and we can really impart good instruction to our children through through such films. Otherwise when you go to the picture you are not going here simply for instruction and learning morals. The main purpose of seeing a picture is to have entertainment and certainly it should not be obscene or objectionable and to stop that the Government has already been given enough power and I say that the government is exercising that power. The complaint is of a different nature and that is that our cinemas lack purpose. If you see pictures you will find that out of them 95% are just the same story of a boy and a girl and nothing beyond that. There is no real purpose or real drama except in certain films which are produced mostly in Bengal and there we find that authors of eminence are there and their works are being put on the screen. There are people for whom we have very great respect even in the film line who are very seriously thinking about this matter and who are quite alive to their responsibilities. Such films should be given encouragement by the Government not through the Censor Board but by the Government.",
86: "Sir it is my proud privilege to initiate this important debate on the Eleventh Plan in this August House. Although I have been in charge of the Ministry of Planning only for a few days I have had the opportunity along with my colleagues in the Cabinet of considering the Plan in its various aspects and I shall try to present before you the salient features of the Plan in the perspective of Government’s general overall economic objectives. Let me say at the outset that the Eleventh Plan covering the years 2007-08 to 2012-13 has been formulated in the light of the development experience of the past three decades and the perspective we need to keep for the next 10 to 15 years. The country’s performance in the past has yielded very valuable lessons; and we must adapt our strategy of development in the light of this experience. The initial conditions from which the Plan had to commence were far from favourable. 1999-00 was a drought year during which agricultural production slumped; there was a sharp rise in prices which continued during 2002 and many weaknesses appeared in the basic infrastructure of coal transport and power which in turn had adverse consequences for industrial growth. Internationally we faced a sharp rise in prices of petroleum and other imports while recessionary conditions in the industrialised world held out a threat for our exports. In a situation such as this it was not easy for the Government and the Planning Commission to chart the course of the country for the next five ten or fifteen years which would be bold or definitive. At the same time the problems facing the country are so acute that solutions brook no delay. Removal of poverty and unemployment and attainment of self-reliance have been the basic goals of planned development and they remain so for the Eleventh Plan as well. In order to move forward towards these objectives it is essential- although not sufficient- to achieve a high rate of growth of national income. The Plan thus aims at a growth rate of 5.2 per cent per annum. This is not an ambitious target especially since 1999-00 was year of low output. But it still requires assiduous efforts to utilise excess capacity in the system and to build new productive capacities in industry as well as agriculture in power and in transport so as to sustain the momentum of development in the years to come beyond the present Plan period. We think this effort can be made. Indeed in the first eighteen months since this Government came to power such an effort has been made. As a result the growth rate last year was 7 per cent and is likely to be 4.5 per cent this year. Thus the average for the plan may come to 6 per cent. In order to achieve the target growth rate of 5.2 per cent both agriculture and industry will have to perform better than in the past. In terms of gross value added the Plan envisages an average growth rate of about 4 per cent for agriculture and about 7 per cent for mining and manufacturing. The realisation of these targets will require a substantial step-up in investment as well as a considerable improvement in capacities which have already been created particularly in such critical sectors as irrigation power coal petroleum fertilisers cement and railways. The Eleventh Plan lays balanced emphasis on both these aspects. The country is currently self-sufficient in foodgrains. However there are still gaps in such important areas as pulses and vegetable oilseeds. Agriculture being still the foundation of our economy the Eleventh Plan contains a number of programmes designed to further strengthen the modernising impulses in agriculture covering both food and cash crops. As a part of the overall strategy the area under irrigation is sought to be increased by nearly 15 million hectares over the Plan period. The consumption of chemical fertilisers is expected to go up from 5 million tones of nutrients in 1999-00 to 9 million tonnes in 2004-05. The institutional credit for agriculture and rural development will be more than doubled over the Plan period. The newly planned National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development will act as a powerful agent for overcoming the weaknesses of the credit delivery systems particularly in meeting the credit needs of small and marginal farmers and rural artisans. Apart from crop husbandry considerable stress has been laid on the development of subsidiary occupations like animal husbandry horticulture fisheries social and farm forestry. The dairy development programme alone is expected to benefit about 15 million families. It is the declared policy of the Government to provide remunerative prices for farm produce and to strengthen the infrastructure for marketing so that farmers have an adequate incentive to produce more.",
87: "I would like to ask the Government why the Government has not put the provisions of the Plantation Labour Act into operation. Only certain portions of this Plantation Labour Act are now put into operation. What is the objection on the part of the Government to put this entire Plantation Labour Act all its provisions into operation? If this had been done certainly some benefits would have been derived by the workers which the Government is withholding at present. Particularly these tea garden owners take advantage of this. They not only exploit the labourers to the maximum extent but also put so many other difficulties in the life of the workers wage cut etc. When I say they cut the wages of workers they effect the cut in wages not by direct cut in wages but they increase the workload taking advantage of the position in which the workers are now placed. For example a certain amount as basic pay is given to the workers but a far higher amount of work is got from them than what they used to do before. Now they have become bound to do more work. The workers pluck more tea today than they used to do before. Up till very recently one worker was asked to pluck buds from 250 plants now he is asked to pluck from 400 plants. That is how they increase the workload. In certain tea gardens sixty to seventy per cent workload has been increased. This is generally going on. Government do not take any measures to check that increase in workload. Instead of utilising this fund the profits can be controlled. The Government should ask the plantation owners to give more amenities such as residential facilities free education to their children facilities to plant in fallow lands etc. Fallow lands are available in certain gardens. These workers should be given the facility to cultivate tapioca and other food materials so that they may meet their daily necessities. The Government should ask these plantation owners to increase the wages of the workers and also to increase the wages of those workers who are skilled workers. There is the factory labour inside plantations and there are field workers and there are so many other categories of labour. The Government is not doing anything substantial for the workers. Sir I find that something like one and a half lakhs of rupees have been granted to the Kerala Government for welfare work among the plantation labour. So far as our experience goes we never have the opportunity to come across such activities organized on behalf of the Government. I do not know whether there is any such activity anywhere. On the contrary there are certain measures taken under the Preventive Detention Act to fight the workers and to pelt stones at the meetings of the workers and also to employ police to lathicharge the workers. That is the sort of welfare activities they have been doing. But what we demand is that the Government should see that the Plantation owners are asked to pay higher wages to the workers and to improve their conditions of living. Now there are one-room tenements but the workers want three-room tenements. And they have not so far been provided with such facilities. I understand that the Government have got some idea of having modern tenements in the estates but so far nothing has been done. We suggest that a part of these profits should be utilized for giving educational facilities to the children of the estate labourers. Also the wages of the workers should be increased and all sorts of facilities should be provided to the estate labourers. That is what I have to say. Mr. Deputy Chairman I welcome this Bill and I am very glad that the hon. Minister has given the assurance that this increased cess will be utilised mainly for the improvement of the living conditions of the workers in these plantations. But I beg to submit Sir that the price of tea is rising in the English markets and I suggest that as good businessmen we should realise and our Government should realise that if the price goes up beyond a certain limit the consumption will go down. We should not adopt a narrow policy and allow the price to go up by leaps and bounds. Of course it does give some profit to the local planters and probably to our Government directly or indirectly in the shape of income-tax earned from these plantations. But as I said before this is a short-sighted policy. The result will be that in the long run if the price of tea goes beyond a certain limit the consumer will not be able to adjust it within his family budget and therefore the consumer will reduce his consumption of tea. There are other countries also which are taking up the production of tea and we are finding every day new competitors in the tea trade.",
88: "I wish to suggest very seriously that if protection is to be given to any industry particularly for the first time the period of protection should be at least two years in the first instance if not three years. My reasons for this suggestion are in the first place that when protection is given to any industry it is on the basis of the recommendation of the Tariff Commission. Now for instance protection is given to an Industry from 1st January 2005 for one year for the first time. The industry itself will not be able to know its real position and it will not be able to feel its way. It must be in a position to feel its way. The object of giving protection is to enable the industry concerned to plan for its future production to find out the possibilities of marketing its product and also to build itself up to meet the domestic demand as it grows. Unless the industry concerned is able to stimulate the domestic demand in which case it will have to step up its production it will not be able to establish itself. So from this point of view the industry ought to be given sufficient time to stabilise itself. From another point of view if the protection given to an industry is to be continued or to be discontinued the Tariff Commission will have to sit again and report on the real position of the industry concerned and will have to start its enquiry within a period of say six months after the protection was first given. That seems to me rather very curious because the industry itself will not be able to know exactly what its position in regard to protection is. I illustrate my point with regard to one of the industries which are listed in this note. Take for instance the titanium dioxide industry. This industry started production in the year 2001. It is a new industry and it consumes the essential raw materials available in the country but it was not able to make much progress from 2001 to 2003. It was because it was not able to make any headway the Tariff Commission recommended protection to it from the end of 2003 or the beginning of 2004 after making due enquiry. Now the industry is given protection only for one year i.e. to the end of this year. The Tariff Commission has got to make an enquiry once again. The industry does not know exactly what its real position in the country is. This is a very peculiar kind of industry. It has got to face competition from huge producers in the world market. It is in a position to stabilise itself if given sufficient protection and opportunity. If the industry does not know exactly what its future is going to be it cannot make any plans either in regard to production or marketing or in regard to the possibilities of stimulating the demand for the product. So I suggest that when protection is given to any industry for the first time it must be at least for a period of three years so that it may know exactly whether it can stimulate demand and whether it can produce sufficient quantity to meet the local demand. Otherwise the industry will not be able to stabilise itself. Sir there is another point of view also. It is seen from the note supplied to us that in the case of several industries protection has been given altogether for a period of say 4 or 5 or 6 years not at one stretch but in instalments. The effect of giving protection to an industry in instalments say for a year is not the same as the cumulative effect of protection given to an industry for a continuous period of 3 years. If it is given for say 3 years at a stretch it will be able to make its programme for the future regarding production etc. So I seriously suggest that though as a matter of fact in the case of several industries protection has been given for a long period in instalments the protection ought to be given in the first instance at least for a period of 3 years. Otherwise as in the case of this titanium dioxide industry it will not be able I am sure to meet competition from outside and it will not be able to stand on its own feet if it is given protection only for one year. So I suggest very seriously that protection given to any industry ought to be in the first instance at least for a period of 3 years. Coming to this note circulated I find that in the case of the calcium chloride industry it is proposed to continue the protection to this industry as suggested by the Tariff Commission.",
89: "The hon. members who have spoken before said that the small growers get the correct price from the Board. This is not so. The entire bulk of the profits they make in the home market and in the foreign market is kept by the bigger growers who dominate this Coffee Board. The price they get is more than what they pay to the small growers. That is the complaint of the small growers. So it is not correct to say that the profits this Board makes are equally distributed to the small growers. Hence the conflict between the big growers and the small growers is increasing. Therefore it is necessary on the part of the Government to do justice to the small growers. The Government thinks that by taking powers for nominating the President of the Board it is able to do justice to the small growers. The number of the small growers is 34000 while the number of the big growers is 590. Most of the seats reserved for the growers in the last Board were monopolised by the big growers. The majority of the seats were held by the big growers and the number of seats the small growers got was very meagre. It was not more than four if my recollection is correct. What the Government should have done was to give equal representation to the small growers. They should have asked the growers to return their representatives or to give a panel of names from which Government could have chosen some. The choice of the representatives should have been left to the respective organisations. If there was no organisation for the small growers Government should have asked them to organise one separately and then send in their representatives. Our friends said that the representatives of the small growers were there on the existing Board. It is true but I know the practice of these big growers or big industrialists. Having given membership to the smaller fry on their organisation they don’t allow them to express themselves. The Chairman or the man who holds sway of the Board sees to it that all the members agree to what he dictates. That is the practice in these associations. We know that. So it is better to have a separate organisation for the small growers and ask them to submit their panel of names to represent them on the Board. Representation on the Board should not be governed by the number of acres owned and the amount of capital invested but by the number of the growers. If this principle is adopted the bigger growers will not be able to run away with what they want. In this connection I would also say that instead of nominating the President the Government should do this. The Government should ask the respective organisations of the big growers the small growers labour and the consumers to send in the names of their representatives and then include Members of Parliament. Then the Board constituted in this way should be asked to elect its Chairman. If this procedure is adopted then the Government can see that no big grower is elected to the chairmanship. In that case only a man who can command a majority in the Board will be elected and that man will see to it that justice is done to all the interests concerned. But here the Government in the name of taking over control of the industry wants to bureaucratise the whole industry. I don’t think that by bureaucratising the Board the Government will be able in any way to help the industry to develop or to bring about better working conditions for the Labour. One member in the Select Committee said that no representation should be given to labour. That is the attitude of the growers. That is the attitude generally of all employers in this country. But it is just on their part to deny representation to labour as well as to the consumers? Certainly the rights of these people should be recognised but personally I don’t think that by merely giving representation to labour on the Board the Government can do justice to labour. It is true that the Minister in the Select Committee as well as in his reply to the debate in the other House said that the working conditions of labour were very pitiable and deplorable and should be improved. Sir there was also a petition sent to the Lok sabha by the employees of the Coffee House recommending to the House that their petition should be considered. The employers deny the rights of workers and they say that they have made all efforts to develop the industry in all these 13 years. At whose cost? It is at the cost of the workers by paying them low wages. They have made a huge profit which is expressed in the reply of Mr. Radcliffe to a question of the hon. Minister for Commerce and Industry that he had been distributing a dividend of 13.5 per cent in one year. In one year he had given 20 per cent dividend in another year 27 per cent and in yet another year he gave 19 per cent to his shareholders. At the same time this big dividend is after deducting the expenses including depreciation taxation reserve fund and reserve fund to capital invested. Apart from all these they have made a net profit so as to distribute an average dividend at 13.5 per cent. Can anybody imagine that such an industry should be allowed to distribute this high dividend at the cost of the poor labour who actually produced this profit? Certainly at the cost of the poor labour and the people they have got this profit. The coffee houses are getting coffee at the rate of Rs. 210 per cwt. At the same time how do they sell coffee there?",
90: "Now there is another aspect of the rubber industry namely the rubber producing industry which has been entirely left out of the consideration of this Bill that is the rubber manufacturing industry. My hon. friend Mr. R.P. Sinha has rightly pointed out that aspect. We find that Indian rubber production has been consumed by the rubber manufacturing industry in India. So here is the question of increasing Indian production. As with the tea trade the question is of export. As yet the structure of the tea trade and the trends of the tea trade are such that it is mainly dependent on export and whenever there is any loss of export market there is a hue and cry of a crisis. But in the case of the rubber industry all the rubber produced in India is consumed by the rubber manufacturing industry in India. Rubber is a very important commodity and this industry should also be developed here. There is a deficit in Indian production. So the Government thinks of allowing import of rubber. If the production of rubber is increased by 27000 tons a year that will be consumed in India. That is all very true. So my point is that in connection with the development of the rubber industry we cannot leave the rubber manufacturing industry out of our consideration. These are closely connected with one another. Coming to the question of the rubber manufacturing industry my friend Mr. R.P. Sinha has rightly pointed out that it is also dominated mainly by foreign companies. The rubber manufacturing industry in India produces various types of rubber goods from tyres to water-proofs and other rubber materials. They produce tyres and tubes cables general mechanical goods including roofing footwear and so on. But the predominant position in the rubber manufacturing industry is occupied by Messrs Dunlop Rubber Company Messrs Firestone Tyre & Rubber Company Bata India etc and from the figures which have been given in the report of the Indian Tariff Board it is seen that the average total consumption of rubber is distributed among a large number of small industries. Here also the question that arises in this. How should we treat these concerns – these big gigantic concerns? Sir I have not studied the condition of labour in these industries of Messrs Dunlop Firestone and Goodyear Company. Therefore just now I am not in a position to give you the picture of their condition but the question is that from the price of rubber in India in relation to the world price of rubber these people are mostly benefiting. It is true that prices cannot be fixed in such a way that the big concerns will pay one price for the rubber and the small concerns will pay another price for rubber. Here also the main question that comes is this. If we want to develop the small units the question arises of putting some check on the profits made. These big foreign concerns must go. It is they who are taking all the advantage of the present position in India. About that aspect I find that there has been no mention in the Bill and there was no indication in the speech of the hon. Minister for Commerce. Then lastly I would like to say that here also the Government has taken the power to appoint the Chairman and is going to reconstitute the Board. The same remarks which I made in connection with the Chairman of the Coffee Board are valid here. If it is the intention of the Government to break the domination of the foreign rubber growers or big rubber growers in the rubber Board I think it will be circulated to hon. Members later on. Let there not be any foreign representation on the Board. If the Government is not prepared to accept that suggestion then also it can take certain other minimum steps. It can increase the representation of small growers; it can increase the representation of labour. The representation of small growers has been increased by one but the representation of labour should be increased. I do not suggest the number now. In this manner if the Government thinks that the reconstitution of the Rubber Board is essentially necessary in order to exercise its powers for the development of the rubber industry then the reconstitution should be on proper lines not simply by having a nominated Chairman not simply by indulging in eyewash activities. The Government should do everything to check the big foreign interests and big growers. Mr. Vice-Chairman as has been pointed out we have a series of similar Bills. Rubber is a cash crop and therefore I think the Government should be very careful to see that in fixing the price of rubber the price of the manufactured articles is borne in mind. The hon. Member who preceded me has pointed out that the rubber manufacturers are mostly foreign firms and the figures that he has given are really staggering. It has been pointed out that during the last ten or twelve years the profits distributed are 350 per cent. That means the original one crore of rupees have received three and a half crores of rupees as profit. It has also been pointed out that one crore of rupees have become two crores of rupees by means of bonus shares and the market price of the shares of two crores of rupees is nearly seven crores of rupees. That means that the original one crore of rupees become ten crores of rupees in our country. The foreigners are multiplying their profits. They are expanding their industries and getting a stronghold on our economy. The hon. Members of this House give protection. They want Indian industries to develop but the advantage of this protection is taken by the foreigners. They set up factories in our country and if at all some money is brought from outside it multiplies ten-fold.",
91: "Mr. Vice-Chairman I accept the principle of the separation of the Railway Finance from the General Finance. I also accept the desirability of this arrangement. It is not only a convenient arrangement but it is based on sound principles and is conducive to the better administration of the Railways. I also agree that the contribution of the Railways to the General Revenues should be in the shape of fixed dividends but I cannot agree that the dividend should be fixed at 4 per cent and that is the crux of the whole report. As a matter of fact the Committee was instituted only to go into that matter whether the dividend payable at the present time i.e. 4 per cent was reasonable or not and whether this arrangement should continue. When I say that I do not agree to the rate of dividend I wish to submit that enough material has not been placed in our hands to judge whether the dividend which is being fixed is fixed on some sound basis or not. The Committee has not examined certain vital matters concerning the administration of the Railways and what I find is that the whole arrangement is very superficial. It appears to me that the Railway Administration and the Finance Administration came to an agreement and the Committee did not find it necessary because of the agreement between the two Ministries to examine and go into the vital matters which affect this issue. It is not clear how this dividend if fixed at 4 per cent is going to react on the working of the Railways and particularly on the future development of the Railways and also on the present structure of the fares and freights. This question has not at all been examined and we do not know what reaction it is likely to have. These are very vital matters and I think that they need a thorough examination before we can come to correct conclusion in this matter. As we know there is a pressing demand for reduction in the Railway fares particularly for third class passengers. This demand has been made on the floor of this House and I think there is great justification behind this demand and more particularly now when we find that the prices of agricultural goods have gone down we will have to take into consideration the question whether the rural population who will get much lesser return for their products now will be able to pay the same fares and freights. I also wish to draw your attention to the fact that the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce had submitted a memorandum to the hon. the Railway Minister asking him for an examination and revision of the freight structure. I do not know what the position today is and unless and until we are enlightened about that unless and until we know where we stand in relation to freights and fares we are not in a position to take any decision whether the rate of dividend should be 4 per cent or not. I should like to ask the hon. the Railway Minister whether in view of this strong demand made by the people through their representatives in both the Houses of Parliament and in view of the changing economy with which we are faced he can give us an assurance that he will be able to discharge his obligations and responsibilities and commitments that he will be able to pay a dividend of 4 per cent and yet he will be able to reduce the freight and fare rates. That is the basic thing. Another important factor which has to be taken into consideration is the development schemes. I wish to submit that there is no new approach in this matter. I find that we are going about in this matter in the same frigid manner and the aspirations of the people have not at all been taken into consideration. The hon. Railway Minister will remember that during the Budget speeches made on the floor of this House as well as in the other House there have been incessant demands for the development of the Railways. I don’t know what he thinks about it and how he thinks that after paying this dividend at 4 per cent he will be able to meet that demand and he will be able to find a way for the Railways to expand their economy as they think it proper as would meet the demands and aspirations of the people. In this connection I wish to invite your particular attention to the facts. I will be happy if we could pay even a larger percentage but the fact is that we must be sure that the Railways are in the present circumstances in a position to do so and yet discharge their responsibilities and obligations and satisfy the needs and demands of the people which are legitimate and justified. Now when we fix the dividend at 4 per cent what happens is that we also fix that of those projects which are to be considered as remunerative at 5 per cent because the Railways want a margin of 1 per cent. What actually happens is that when we fix it at such a high level because of this percentage we find that not many new projects are really taken up and we have been very seriously disappointed in this matter. I therefore think that in the present circumstances the Railways cannot afford to pay a dividend of 4 per cent. May I ask the Railway Minister whether it is not a fact that even he has not been able to contribute fully or even he will fall short by about Rs. 60 crores in his contribution towards the Plan? Out of the Rs. 400 crores that the Railways have to contribute I find from his speech that they are faced with a net shortfall of about Rs. 62 crores.",
92: "This question Sir in my humble opinion should be viewed from a different angle from which it was looked at and discussed here yesterday. It is true that it is correct in principle that the Railways whose entire capital-at-charge is drawn from the General Revenues should be able to make a good contribution to the General Revenues but in applying this principle care must be exercised. If we are looking at railway system in advanced countries like the United Kingdom or the United States of America or any such country this principle no doubt could be applied on all fours. But in a country like India whether it could be applied is a question that should be considered. It was argued that the Railways have a long history and because they have long been an established concern they should now be able to contribute o the General Revenues. Although it is true that the Railways are a long-established concern still the circumstances under which the Railways were run are not being examined here. The Railways as we all know before independence were run not on a welfare State basis but they were run on the system of strategic lines. When the railway lines in India were formed it was not the question of developing economic resources it was not the question of linking up industrial centres it was not the question of linking up the railway system with pilgrim centres or centres of density that prompted the authorities the private companies to start the Railways in India but it was the strategic concern of the British Government then that prompted these companies to form Railways. The question of arriving at a correct pattern of railway system from the point of view of developing and exploiting the natural resources of the country from the point of view of developing the backward areas of the country is still there to be examined and to be attended to. Well from this point of view as anybody can see there is much scope for developing the Railways. In fact there is so much pressure on hon. the Railway Minister for new lines that one will be at a loss as to where to find the resources from. They have undertaken in the second part of the Five Year Plan to construct new lines of 1500 kilo metres in length. In order to have a perfect railway pattern to be able to exploit and make use of the natural resources of the country to the fullest extent although we cannot dismantle the railway lines that we have now still these lines have to be linked up to fulfil that requisite of exploiting the natural resources. So my point in bringing out these arguments is to show that the Railways have a full development programme on their hands and they need funds. They can no longer draw from the General Revenues or the country as the Railway Finance is separated from the General Finance. They have to obtain the resources that are required for development either by loan or otherwise. There is the other need also to be examined in this connection the need of passenger amenities. Both inside these Houses of Parliament as well as outside it has been agitated that passenger amenities are required to be given in a larger and larger number. The second class passengers before independence did not get adequate amenities. In fact the condition of the bogies the condition of the waiting rooms the condition of catering facilities and the condition of housing all these things needed much attention. Although the Railways have now taken up the amenities programme and according to the recommendation of the Convention Committee we are now earmarking Rs.3 crores per annum for this purpose still I think it is totally inadequate. The Railway Administration has now recognised the fact that greater and greater passenger amenities are to be given. But they are not going on the right lines. I may make this statement clear by saying that they are not following proper lines with regard to the amenities that are to be given. I will take just one example and point out how they fall short of the requirements. Well the question of providing waiting halls for second class passengers has been a much-mooted question and that naturally gets a top priority in the amenities programme. Well the so-called waiting halls that are now provided are like this. The halls are there; the exit gate from the platform opens into the hall and the entry gate into the platform opens into the hall so much so that in fact the hall is only a passage. When people come and go how can the second class passengers take rest here? That is a question which I have not been able to understand. Secondly for the passengers who have to wait for a number of hours in these halls necessary sanitary facilities should be provided. Now the sanitary arrangements may be inside the platforms where the waiting passengers cannot go. And if they go and commit nuisance outside the policeman will be there to haul them up and prosecute them under the police regulations for committing nuisance. So it is not imagined that when passengers are required to wait for ten hours or twelve hours in these waiting halls they should have some bath-room facilities as we have for first class or for higher class passengers. That thing has not been visualised. Even for our cattle-sheds in our houses we have doors and windows but here for these second class waiting halls there is neither a door nor a window nor an enclosure. This I say to draw the attention of the authorities to think of these amenities in their proper proportion. Their estimate of the requirements of funds for these amenities is an under-estimate. The needs for increasing the amenities are large.",
93: "Sir coming from the south we are very happy that after a prolonged struggle after a good deal of suffering by the people and after several movements have been conducted by the people’s representatives Pondicherry has become one with us though not still according to law. It is gratifying to know that the people of Pondicherry and the surrounding French settlements are very happy about their being reunited with the motherland and it is in the fitness of things that the Government of India has come and asked for sanction of expenditure there. With regard to Pondicherry and other French settlements in the South what the Government of India has been doing and what the Chief Commissioner has been doing have won the approval of all the section of the people. Pondicherry has been going through very very difficult time and there have been uncertain political conditions for the past so many months and it is really surprising how the law and order situation has been so successfully tackled and how the people after a very long time have been assured of perfect law and order in that area. Pondicherry has been notorious for the disturbances and in the past two months the situation worsened because of lack of cooperation between the Administration and the people and it is after a very long spell of time that the people of Pondicherry are enjoying a stable government. The Government of the day and the Chief Commissioner have been doing their best to establish perfect and cordial relations between all sections of the people. The Chief Commissioner is also trying to give the people of Pondicherry a perfect democratic set-up. So it is not true to say that he has been doing things which are not in the interests of the people on which are not conductive to democratic functioning of institutions there. All the political parties which have been openly siding for the merger have been recognised and it is with them that we have to get along till elections are held in Pondicherry till final decision is made by the people whether they would be with the Indian Union or not. Till then the Government of India have done a good thing in nominating people’s representatives to official positions so that there may be better collaboration between the people and the Government. It has also been said that they have provided enough money for carrying out ordinary repairs and also for medical facilities and other amenities that are necessary to the people of the place. I would like to refute the allegation that the Government have been partial to one political party and are trying to dominate other political party and are trying to dominate other political parties which also worked for the freedom of the people. The Government have been taking a non-partisan attitude and have recognised the claims of the people. It is the people who have to finally decide and the people’s representatives have been given the recognition. All the political parties which were working for the merger of Pondicherry with the Indian Union have been recognised and the predominant political party of the day which did contribute greatly to the merger movement has been given recognition and that has the approval of the people. Moreover it is untrue to say that the police is trying to dominate and is trying to force the people to submit by the use of bayonets and arms. The police is there to protect the people against the onslaught by undesirable elements in the area. So the police are doing a very difficult but a responsible job and the people of Pondicherry have no complaint and most sections in the settlement fully support the move of the government. Pondicherry will be with us soon and we hope that the people of Pondicherry will vote for the merger of Pondicherry territory with our own. It was said that at Pondicherry and other places certain political parties which worked for the liberation movement have been ignored and that they are being suppressed. It is not so. All the political parties except the Indian National Congress which was having a branch there were formerly with the French Government and they did not want freedom. In the past two months they voted for the merger actually the dejure transfer of power from the French Administration. Today Pondicherry is able to get along well with the other sections of the people and the people have welcomed the merger with great relief. It was the people who were suffering it was the common man it was the worker it was the ordinary people who had to depend on the mainland for the supply of necessities. They were put to a lot of difficulty before and now they have got almost all the necessities of life supplied to them at a very reasonable cost. Now there is free movement of these essential things and the people of Pondicherry are very happy about it. There was only one section grumbling about in Pondicherry and that is the merchant class. They have made a complaint that with the stopping of licences to import and also due to the cancellation of many import licences they have been put to a great loss. They have been the worst sufferers because they will have to fulfill their contracts. I would like the home Minister to consider this aspect that whether the licences that have been granted by the previous Administration can be held valid of course subject to the financial interests of our country because people also take this opportunity to cheat the Government of India of their legitimate share of taxes and also the import duty . Similarly there is one irksome feature which has been the subject of many a complaint by the people of Pondicherry and that is the customs barriers still exist. There are lots of people who are going to Pondicherry everyday and these people are being put a lot of customs difficulties.",
94: "In the course of the discussion it has been very ably pointed out by a large number of speakers as to how the rubber industry is in the grip of certain foreign elements and Indian monopolists at the top. We know that there are small planters and producers but the hold of the Dunlop Company was also mentioned. So far as the big industries are concerned it has been their policy to capitalise the money and to put money in the reserve fund instead of utilizing such funds and profits for improvement of the working classes and for the betterment of the labourers. It was pointed out yesterday that the Dunlop Company gave very high dividends. You will be shocked to know that while the Company had money to declare a dividend of 40 per cent and also to capitalize a part of the profits it did not give at all a fair deal to the workers. On the contrary they were kept at more or less the same old level where they had a kind of labour practically speaking. Therefore it becomes necessary to look into this matter. Sir we are interested in the increase in production and everybody is interested in the increase in production. The production of rubber coffee or of any other essential commodities or imported commodities must undoubtedly be increased in the country. But merely by appointing a Board or by taking certain powers into the Government’s hands or investing the Board with such powers you cannot ensure increase in production. There may be slight improvement here and there but materially you cannot alter the situation until and unless you inspire the real producers by making them see through their own lives’ experience that increase of production means a constant rise in their standard of living in their material and cultural well being. Now that is why I say that it is very essential when the Board is really being given certain powers for looking after the interests of the working class to make these powers effective and to make them effective would be to ask the Board to work for the increase of the wages of the rubber workers or the labourers who work in that particular industry. Now that is not there. It is a very unhappy omission and a very sad omission if the intention of the Bill is good. Sir as you know we had been told in the recent days very much about socialism and we are not talking about socialism in its big aspects here at all. This is not our concern here. But if you at all really have such feelings if you think that socialism is something which one has to swear by even though the ideas of socialism were first propagated one century ago then give some expression to it. But we know that there will not be socialism at all under you. All that we say is if you swear by socialism talk about socialism if the Members of that side of the House go to some other Houses and hear lectures very seriously they should come here and tell us that they are also going to increase the wages of the workers when such measures are brought up. Such occasions are good occasions for them to begin to cultivate this thing because you have yet to learn the ABC of socialism first and you cannot write a book or a poem or an article straightaway and we do not expect you to do it either. But if you are really sincere about what you are talking you should try to learn the ABC that is to say begin with giving the workers a fair deal giving them a living wage and dealing with the workers here in this Bill you should make provisions for them. I do not suggest to the Minister that in this Bill there should be provision that so much wages shall be given to the rubber plantation worker or fix a scale and all that sort of thing. All that I have proposed in this amendment is that the Board should be given that reorientation of outlook should be given the direction that the wages have to be increased and that they have to consciously work for it. That is all that I demand in this amendment. Sir we do not like that our workers should be exploited by the people and he will not deny because it has been pointed out from that side of the House also that huge profits are being amassed they cannot spend the money the british who are earning out of this industry cannot spend the money. With all their luxury and extravagance they cannot spend that money here in this country. They send this money abroad. Even then they retain some money in their hands. They would rather keep them in banks idle than give this money to the workers for bettering their lot for improving their conditions which determines in the final analysis whether the production of the country would go up or not. Now Sir I read with great interest the Select Committee’s Report especially the portion of the evidence appended to it and I would ask you also Sir to re-read if you have already read this interesting document. You see here Mr. T.T. Krishnamachari crossing swords with an important representative of the British interests the British rubber interests in this country. Now it is all a wordy battle. It is a sort of very interesting competition for being smart one trying to overreach another in smartness. But at the same time out of these discussions in emerges that the British interests are totally unmindful of the interests of the worker of the interests of the country as a whole although the British gentleman who came here to give evidence spoke of national interests and all that. Here you will find many interests.",
95: "Sir the hon. Minister has said that because this Bill is of a complicated nature he has come forward with this measure to extend the blanket cover that is to be given by another one year. Sir in my opinion the Bill as such is not complicated but the Government have made it more complicated by getting into certain things which in my opinion are certainly extraneous for the purpose of this Bill. Sir in the course of one year this Bill has come up before this House three times. This is the third time that this Bill is coming up before the House. The parent Bill was introduced in December 2003 and in less than one year two amending Bills were being moved before us. Even at the time when the parent Bill was moved it was suggested by several Members both on this side as well as on the other side of the House that it is safe to enumerate in the Bill itself by attaching a schedule to it to specify clearly provisions as to what would amount to an office of profit and what would not amount to an office of profit. It was then stated by the attach hon. mover of the Bill that it was not necessary to attach any schedule to the Bill and that the Bill by itself as moved was comprehensive enough. Then Sir certain difficulties were felt and various Members of this House as well as of the other House had addressed the hon. Law Minister then asking him whether their remaining in a particular committee would amount to an office of profit or not. Probably looking at the numerous letters that had been addressed to the hon. Law Minister he was in a dilemma as to what to do. He had come forward with an amending Bill to extend the life till the end of December 2004. A committee was constituted to advise the hon. Law Minister as to which offices would amount to offices of profit and which offices would not amount to offices of profit. Sir I am told by one or two members who had served in that Advisory Committee that only once only during this session they were summoned to meet. I would ask the hon. Minister Sir this question: When it was such an important measure what was the Ministry doing from April 2004 till December 2004 excepting to come forward before the House with another amending Bill of this nature? Originally Sir only four months’ time was asked for when the parent Bill was moved and it was stated that within the period of four months they would come forward with a comprehensive legislation. Then again they came forward with another amending Bill extending the period till December 2004. Now between April and December nothing has happened expecting that the Advisory Committee has been constituted and it met once only just to recommend for extending the period by another one year. Sir nobody in both the Houses would oppose this measure but they can only criticize the way in which the Government is dealing with this measure the way in which the Government is sleeping over the matter a matter which affects the very life of a Member of Parliament not only a Member of Parliament but also a Member of the State Legislature. As the hon. the Law Minister has pointed out Article 102 of our Constitution does not define what is an office of profit except to say that a Ministership or a Deputy Ministership or even a Parliamentary Secretaryship and by a later amendment even a whip of the Congress Party would not amount to an office of profit. Only a few instances are specified as to which offices would not amount to an office of profit. Then Sir complications has arisen even when the original Bill was moved introducing statutory committees and advisory committees. What a statutory committee was or what an advisory committee was was not at all defined in the parent Bill. So doubts had arisen in the minds of various Members as to what would amount to a statutory committee or what would amount to an advisory committee or even whether a Vice-Chancellorship of a University to which are attached certain privileges like the appointment of so many persons and all that was defined as not an office of profit and the hon. the Law Minister was not able to say what office would amount to an office of profit what would amount to a statutory committee or what would amount to an advisory committee. Sir I have only to point out that an important measure such as this which affects the very existence of the Members of parliament should have been given a very high priority in the matter of legislation. On the contrary not much attention was given to this. The Committee met only once and even then nothing seems to have happened in that Committee. Sir before the matter goes to a court of law for the Judges and for the lawyers to interpret what would amount to an office of profit it is better that the hon. the Law Minister brings forward in the coming Budget session a comprehensive Bill which will specify in its schedules what are offices of profit. The schedules may be of a positive character or of a negative character. The schedules might say that the holders of such and such offices would not be disqualified from being Members of Parliament or Members of State Legislatures or the schedules might say in a negative way that such and such offices are offices of profit so that the Members of Parliament and Members of the State legislatures would know whether to accept an office and whether they would be disqualified by accepting a certain office.",
96: "As you have already pointed out under Article 323 of the Costitution the Union Public Service Commission submits annual reports and these reports are laid before both the Houses of Parliament along with any memorandum if there be any from the Government explaining their position as to why they have not accepted the particular advice of the Commission. Sir we have so far received three such reports from the Commission and I have gone through these reports. Sir the general impression that I have gathered after going through these three reports is that apart from the fact that there have been cases of non-acceptance of the Commission’s advice in many important matters there are Sir very serious irregularities committed by the Executive Government in the matter of appointments to the civil posts and the civil services. If you permit me Sir I may add that I have found that there are occasions when the Government has even by-passed the Houses of Parliament in their anxiety to provide for their favourites. Sir under Article 320 of the Constitution as you have already pointed out the recruitments to civil posts and the civil services are to be made by the Union Public Service Commission. There are two basic ideas underlying this system of recruitment to the civil services adopted in our Constitution. Firstly we desire that all eligible persons to a particular post should be entitled to enter into a fair and free competition to get that job. Secondly we want to avoid all elements of patronage in the matter of appointments to our civil services. You will find that under the old Regulation which has been kept in force under Article 372 there are several categories of employment and post which have been kept away from the purview of the Union Public Service Commission. One of these categories is temporary appointments lasting for less than a year. I maintain from a review of all these reports that the Government has abused this power of temporary appointments. The Government has used it as a shield to bestow all kinds of patronage. Sir if you look at the posts you will find that on the very face of it they are not temporary posts but that they are likely to continue for more than a year. Sir appointments to such posts are made as temporary appointments merely to avoid the Union Public Service Commission. In the name of temporary and emergency appointments I find that a large number of appointments are being made. The glaring examples are the Community Projects Administration and the All India Radio under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. We find as a matter of fact such appointments being made by every Ministry but these are the very glaring examples and I would like the hon. Minister to tell this House as to how many temporary appointments are being made every year by the Government and how many of them are continued even after the end of the year. Sir they make the temporary appointments and they keep these appointments going on year after year and they do not also consult the Commission although under the Constitution they are required to do so. Apart from bringing in an element of patronage in the civil appointments this procedure acts very unfairly to the other candidates who compete from the open market when these temporary posts are made permanent. When the appointments are regularised by inviting applications by means of advertisements what happens is this. We cannot prevent these temporary appointees from competing in such examinations and these temporary appointees who have gained experience at the cost of the tax payer compete with the candidates from the open market and do better because of the experience that they have gained. I know it from my personal knowledge that appointments in the temporary cadre are purposely made in order that a particular candidate may gain experience and do better at competitive examinations and have a better chance of getting a permanent Government service; otherwise he would never have got such a post. Sir not only this but the Commission have also referred to the fact that advertisements are drafted in such a way that it may suit a particular person. On page 9 of the first report they say advertisements for posts in the category of technical scientific or specialized qualifications are often so drafted by Ministries as to tend to restrict the recruitment to the limited circle of persons already holding the posts advertised or analogous posts. One of the main functions of the commission is to so draft the advertisement without sacrificing the requirements of the post as to ensure a competitive selection for the post from the widest field. I have looked into the regulations and the method by which the Public Service Commission works in U.K. There the ministries merely inform the Service Commission that they want such a post to be filled with a person of such and such qualifications. The advertisement is drafted by the Service Commission and not by the Ministries as is done here. Here Government are anxious to bestow patronage and therefore it is that they want to avoid going to the Public Service Commission and continue to make these temporary appointments and draft the advertisements themselves. I find from the Report that as early as January 2001 the Commission submitted their proposals to the Government as to how the existing regulations should be re-modelled so that each case should come under the purview of the Union Public Service Commission. Now the Government has not taken any decision in this matter. These proposals ought to have been placed before both Houses of Parliament as required under the Constitution that the Houses will be fully seized of the problems which are facing appointments and would give their directions as to how appointments in the civil services should be made.",
97: "Sir this volume the Progress Report for the year 2003-04 is before the House and Members will have discovered for themselves that this volume is replete with useful information. It consists of a large volume of facts and figures and it is hardly necessary for me to make a lengthy introduction. This Report is the basis of discussion now. I would make only one request to hon. Members. They will have a lot to say about the various aspects of our economic situation and economic progress of the country. We would welcome all that; they are entitled to make an appraisal of the activities. Let it be a critical appraisal and I hope Sir that it will also be a fair appraisal. In doing so we will have to think not of today not of the conditions in which we are functioning but we have to take our minds back to the days when the idea of a Plan took shape when the proposals that are now before us and the action that has been taken on them was conceived of. What were those conditions? It will be very easy for all of us to recall the days of anxiety through which we are passing then. We were not sure of our food supplies for the next month. We were as some people said living from ship to mouth. We had a certain nervousness about our food supply. We had on account of frantic demands from all parts of the country to move food from one part to another and rush it to places where stocks were low. We had to import large quantities spending large amounts of foreign exchange. We had also to give heavy subsidies and yet people were not satisfied and they could not be. There were controls and there were difficulties experienced by many people. The quantities consumed then were low relative to what a normal human being must consume. Sir this was the situation in respect of food and in respect of other consumer goods also. Cloth was so difficult to obtain even to cover the minimum needs of an ordinary family. We had difficulties in other directions also difficulties about transport and so on and then it was in those very days that the problem of rehabilitation of displaced persons was prominent. We had started tackling it but we had not completed that yet. Prices were rising and so many people felt that at those high prices an average family could not subsist. There were inflationary pressures and so anything that we could do to relieve the situation to increase production to spend money for making large investments created those dangers of increasing inflation of a further rise in prices. That was the dilemma. What is the position now? When we judge of ourselves today we should not think of today. On the basis of conditions today we determine the future and our future performance but so far as the past is concerned it is these conditions that determined our present. What is it that we find today? Our major headaches have been relieved. Nobody can say that food is scarce; nobody can say that cloth is not to be had. In the matter of transport we have greatly improved and our position in several other directions has also improved. For these things it is not necessary to give any figures; the thing is there in the air and it is part of everybody’s experience in the country that the difficulties and the anxieties have more or less gone and that we can breathe freely and can think of the future with confidence. The chief difficulty both in industry and in agriculture was of course that there was not enough production. We were faced with the spectacle of high prices and scarcity of food etc. Also our industries were not running full capacity; existing capacities were not being utilised; in the case of several industries we were using only a part of that capacity. Therefore agriculture was the key to the whole situation. We must produce more raw materials in order to run our industries well. Sir this is what we started doing. We came to the conclusion that we must do everything possible in the course of the five years that we had before us to bring about an increase in agricultural production to the maximum possible extent. We made up our minds that we will free ourselves from the necessity of importing food from outside countries; we wanted to be relieved of this dependence. Sir we have succeeded in that but for doing that we had also to decide that the major part of our resources should be applied to this sector and we decided to increase irrigation facilities major and minor. We decided to make programmes for giving more fertilisers manures improved seeds and reclamation of waste land. In all these directions we have sent some money and we have achieved results in physical terms and those results are very heartening. In the field of irrigation for example we can legitimately take a measure of pride in what has been achieved already. By the end of this year the area irrigated by projects is expected to exceed five million acres. The river valley projects which had been begun before the Plan are now making rapid progress. Work on the new river valley schemes which were included in the Plan for the first time such as the Chambal the Kosi and the Tungbhadra has also begun. On the Kosi preliminary work has been completed and construction is about to begin. Some Members were anxious about Kosi. Estimates of about 7 or 8 crores of rupees have been sanctioned and all preliminary work has been completed. I may tell them that in a few days construction will be taken in hand. At the Kosi Project we also hope to witness the heartening spectacle of large scale public participation.",
98: "Sir as is well-known in 2012 when we passed the Delimitation Commission Act the constituencies were formed on the basis of the census figures arrived at at the last census in 2001. The census authorities at this time worked in a manner which was slightly different from the way in which the work was carried out in 1971. At the time of the census of 1971 as we are aware all castes and sub-castes were mentioned in the census figures. But at the time of the census of 1981 naturally in view of the change in our policy what they did was that they did not enumerate all the castes but only enumerated such castes as were ordered to be enumerated generally as had to be given some special representation under the Orders issued by the President under Article 341. As we are aware Article 341 provides that in the present circumstances the President shall determine the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes to whom for a period of ten years special representation has been given. And under Article 341(2) if at all there is to be any change in these in the list then it is only Parliament that can make that change. At the present moment the position is that at the time of the census of 2001 there was an Order giving the lists of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes for whom special representation was to be given. Therefore at the time of the Census of 2001 they tried to collect information only about those cases which were mentioned in that Order for the purpose that they may be given the special representation on that basis. But it appears at the present moment at the time of the actual taking of the census information certain people mentioned their castes a little incorrectly. For instance if a person belonged to some sub-caste at the time of mentioning it to the enumerator he gave it as Harijan. Now Harijan is neither a caste nor is it recognised. So probably at the time of the census of 2001 such people were omitted though they really belonged to the castes enumerated in the Order. Similarly there were certain synonyms of castes and in that case also people of the same caste for whom the protection was intended on account of their giving the wrong description to the enumerator in respect of the name to which they did not exactly belong they were also excluded. Therefore in the 1951 census register which was prepared on the basis of the information thus supplied certain castes were omitted. After the passing of the Bill as we are aware under Article 81 of the Constitution the membership has to bear a certain proportion to the figures of population of the last census. It was however found as for instance in the case of Andhra Pradesh though there is a general increase in the population of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. This was so glaring that it was brought to the notice of the authorities concerned and the census authorities there from whatever information they had corrected these figures because in respect of these they had certain slips or certain other papers giving the information from which they could get the correct figures. That could be corrected because the final Delimitation Orders were not passed at that time. So in respect of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat where the final Order was not passed the census authorities corrected these figures and the Delimitation Commission took that into account and they did their work. But it was found in respect of certain other States also that such corrections were made. But the Delimitation Orders were not passed. Therefore we first intended to bring forward or introduce a Bill in the Lok Sabha only in respect of those States where the Delimitation Commission had not passed its final Orders with the provision that if the Census authorities were to make a change in respect of the figures of population of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes then they could in their final orders take these figures into consideration and delimit the constituencies on that basis. However when the Bill was introduced it was brought to the notice of the Government that in many of the States final orders had been actually passed by the Delimitation Authorities and it was therefore necessary in order that there should be uniformity in the principles followed in respect of this matter that there should be some provision brought in spite of the fact that final orders are passed by the Delimitation Commission that could be reopened but only for this limited purpose wherever the census authorities had to correct these figures and place it on a proper basis. The Delimitation authority should in that case reopen that matter and determine the matter on the basis provided by the Census authorities. Therefore the scope of the Bill to that extent was widened. The Bill which is now before the House is in this form. So far as the delimitation of constituencies is concerned whether it is Andhra Pradesh or Gujarat or whether in respect of other States the Delimitation Commission will be authorized to reopen these matters if the Census authorities had to change the figures of population. Therefore the Bill before the House is a very simple one to that extent. It only enables the Delimitation Commission to take into account the corrections which may be made by the Census authorities. It is primarily the Census authorities who are to do it now.",
99: "The Textile Enquiry Committee says that we are getting much less cloth than we had even under a foreign Government in the year 1938-39. Only one conclusion can be drawn from this statement of the Textile Enquiry Committee in its report. I have great respect for his intelligence and I know that the meaning of the report will not have been lost on him. What I was saying was that Indo-Pakistan trade is very important. In the entire scheme of our import-export trade that does not feature much. The market that we lose there is being taken by the foreigners especially the U.S.A. and U.K. and the market Pakistan loses in our country is being taken up to a great extent by these two countries and if you see the line of trade the fall in the Indo-Pakistan trade has given rise to our trade with one or other of the foreign countries with regard to certain commodities. Our import and export policy does not take initiative to see as to how the trade could be developed with Pakistan. I am aware of the political difficulties that are in the way of the Ministry. At the same time it is the duty of the Ministry to take initiative and bring home the fact that unless and until we put our trade between these two countries where normal and natural economic ties have been disrupted on a proper footing there will always be disadvantages on our side and certain other interlopers will come in and take advantage of that situation in order to ruin our economy and that precisely is what is happening today if you carefully look into the developments in that connection. There is yet another problem of our relations with U.K. that calls for a separate treatment. In the old days the hon. Ministers and their leaders and their camp followers were all complaining against the preferential treatment that was then called Imperial Preference- the various agreements that were arrived at unilaterally for fleecing India’s economy. Times have changed and no longer are we supposed to be in the British Empire; we are a Commonwealth country and a Republic. But what about those preferences? Have they all been abolished? Who are deriving all the benefits out of them? That is a point which needs clarification. Whenever we raise that point we are told that we are deriving more benefits because of these preferences than the United Kingdom but whenever we read their papers- their London Times Economic Section and all other papers emanating from the city of London – we find that they tell their own people that they are happy that they are having this kind of relationship with us and they are gaining by such preferences. Now are we to understand that we are both gaining as a result of these preferences? I don’t think so. The position is not at all so. On the contrary as a result of these preferences India stands to lose. That position I think has not been altered to the satisfaction of our country and the hon. Minister will perhaps clarify that position when he speaks. If these preferences work to the detriment of our economy the time has come when we must give them up. We need not go in for such preferences and I am sure that the policy which is required has got to be adopted in the interests of our entire economy not merely in the interests of our foreign sector and not merely in the interests of any particular sector. Reference has been made to sterling balances. I don’t know how much of the sterling balances is left at the moment. It would not exceed 740 crores. It may be much less. A large part of our sterling balances had been expended with a view to meeting the deficits in the balance of payments. It was thought at the end of the war that these balances which had accumulated there would be utilized for financing certain developments in our country for developing the economy in our country in particular for importing machinery that we direly required. After the termination of the war the reverse process took place. I would only mention what Sir Winston Churchill the Prime Minister at that moment has written in his War memoirs. He is very bitter about India’s claims on sterling balances. He says that he does not like at all that India should make demands on the sterling balances. He thought that he had saved India and therefore India had no right to claim the sterling balances. This is how he has written although he does not use the same blunt words but he makes it very clear. Here is the British Prime Minister who would not like a penny out of the sterling balances to be paid to India but circumstances have compelled him to do so many things. Similarly he has been forced to accept a position where sterling balances had to be paid under certain agreements in instalments and we all know that. But you see that large chunks of the sterling balances had been spent for meeting the deficit in the balance of trade. A much bigger amount had been spent for meeting the deficit in the balance of payments including such items as pensions. You know we have a tapering annuity out of which pensions are paid and that money is paid from the sterling balances. Therefore it is a scandalous thing that these balances had been spent not for the development of the economy of our country but for meeting certain liabilities which we might have just as well avoided and liabilities which we should not even recognise for instance the liabilities with regard to pensions and all that. It is not use trying to explain the position in great detail regarding the sterling balances in our country.",
100: "Sir it is usual in all parliamentary systems of Government for the President at the opening of a session to address both Houses of Parliament. It has been criticised as being merely a narration of facts which have happened during the past year. But that is the usual thing as hon. Members know which happens in most of the Parliaments which work under parliamentary systems of Government. I am sure that the hon. Members are aware that India has always stood for peace and ever since her independence has done what she could to preserve peace in the world. Both in Korea and in Indo-China our efforts led to a cease-fire and for the first time with the settlement of the Indo-China problem there was no shooting war anywhere in the world. But now again there are war clouds especially in the Far East. As has been emphasised by the Prime Minister time and again patience and tolerance are necessary to solve the tangle in Formosa. Our Government have recognised the Chinese People’s Republic as the Government of China and have recognised the Chinese claim to the Cairo Declaration. If the Cairo Declaration is to have any value then it is fairly certain that Formosa is part of China. But at the same time one cannot forget the fact that things have got to be tackled patiently if this problem of Formosa is to be solved in a peaceful manner. That will take time and it is towards that end I am sure that our Prime Minister is working so that there will be no clash in the Far East with regard to the question of Formosa. This has been prominently mentioned in the Address of the President. We hope that patience will be exercised by both the sides to solve this question and there will be no incident which might lead to serious consequences. Our agreement with China on Tibet which formed the basis of the joint statement by China’s and our Prime Ministers regarding Panch Shilla must form the main principle through which international tension can be eased and finally peace established. I am glad sir that recently the King of Laos has accepted the idea of the five principles put forward in this declaration. It is usual in the present time of atomic age to talk about the dangers of the use of atom for warlike purposes. The question is whether the new instrument in the hands of men is going to be used for the benefit of humanity or for the destruction of humanity and human civilization as we know it today. Both the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics possess atomic weapons and the United Kingdom Government has now planned to manufacture hydrogen bombs for their security. As the Prime Minister has pointed out time and again our country is not interested in the production of atomic weapons but we are immensely interested in the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. There is no doubt whatever that in the interests of human civilisation these weapons should not only be banned but destroyed. The question is who is going to take the risk? There have been appeals that as the U.S.A. was the first nation to manufacture these dangerous weapons and use them therefore they should set an example by destroying the bombs in their possession. Stock-pilling of atomic weapons would lead to a dangerous situation and somebody therefore ought to make a start in the matter of the destruction of these weapons. If moral standards are to be the guiding factor it will be a great help to humanity. If this step can be taken if only there is courage to do so the U.S.S.R. will have to follow suit but unfortunately there is the fear complex. Most nations want to protect themselves and want to guard themselves against any surprise attacks by the other side. So the armaments race goes on. They forget that this mentality will eventually lead to war. They think that negotiations can take place only when one can speak from strength but they forget that two can play at this game. So long as this view is held the armament race will go and tension must certainly increase. The Conference which meets in London in a few days’ time on disarmament I hope will find a solution. The complete banning of nuclear weapons must be the first step that any conference should strive at and I hope that under proper international supervision this step will be taken. But connected with this is the question of the reduction of conventional armaments. There must be a realistic approach to this problem. The U.S.S.R. today possesses so much strength that it should be the first to agree to reduce its land army in the interests of the good relations that should exist between nations. One hopes that it will understand this position and take steps to get this done. I am glad that the Atomic Energy Commission of the United Nations has recognised that India has a part to play in this field and has asked our leading nuclear scientist Dr. Bhabha to preside over the Conference proposed to be held at Geneva. The U.S.S.R. has promised to show how she has been able to set up a nuclear plant producing electric power but great steps have been taken in this connection also in the U.K. and the recent report on atomic power placed as a White Paper before the House of Commons shows that by about 1980 there will be about 12 to 13 stations working in various parts of that country to produce electricity and power for peaceful purposes. This is a great step and our country will benefit by the steps that are being taken because our intention is to use atomic power for peaceful purposes.",
101: "Mr. Deputy Chairman there is no dispute in regard to the question that the working journalists had been suffering for long and that they need legal protection in their profession. As they were suffering Government appointed the Press Commission and as a result of the recommendations of the Press Commission we are here discussing this Bill today to safeguard their interest. Now our aim is to protect them for their employers. This Bill gives them protection under the Industrial Disputes Act. As the operation for so many years of this Act was in the hands of the Labour Department or the Labour Ministry that department and that Ministry are fully aware how it should be operated as there have been lot of difficulties and lot of differences of opinion between one court in one State and the other court in the other State in regard to one item and one interpretation. The interpretation is required to be incorporated in this Bill as to what is meant by a ‘workman’. The Industrial Disputes Act has given the definition of the term ‘workman’ but it has been interpreted by the different courts in different States in different ways. Now again we are dealing with two parties and one party is the employer. In the definition of the ‘employer’ also we do not find if we can properly put the directors or the managers as the employers. Now this Bill has tried to exclude certain staff and certain people doing certain jobs. Sir the intention of this measure is to safeguard the interests of the working journalists by bringing them under the purview of the Industrial Disputes Act by which they will be provided with certain machinery where they can go for the redress of their grievances. Sir we must make sure that working journalists may not be defined as ‘employers’ instead of as ‘workmen’. If as we say here an employer is one who is employed in a managerial or administrative capacity there is bound to be difficulty. I will cite an example. Now a working journalist might get two typists in his office and he may have three peons. He may be actually a supervisor acting on behalf of the Manager also. Now he is performing two jobs; he himself is working and he is also performing the work entrusted to him by the Manager or the Managing Director. If such a person has got any grievance he goes to this machinery that is to be appointed under this Bill and he is entitled to get relief. But as he is partially employed as Manager he may be denied that right. Therefore I am afraid that whatever we may try to do we must be very specific in this matter. I think we should say that the working journalist means a person whose principal avocation is that of a journalist etc. etc. and then they are also termed as workmen under the Industrial Disputes Act. Otherwise we will be faced with that sort of difficulty as other trade unions are experiencing in their day-to-day work in the appellate tribunal or the Industrial Tribunal or in other courts. I hope that the Minister in charge of this Bill will consult the Labour Minister who is an expert in this matter as to how to safeguard really the interests of these people by putting a proper definition for the working journalists. Now I have got another point. Really this should have been brought forward by the Labour Department as they have been operating the Industrial Disputes Act. Under the Industrial Disputes Act we have got some machinery which has got to come into being when there is a dispute. Now under the existing Industrial Disputes Act the appropriate Government has got to order in writing to this machinery. As the working journalists are spread over throughout the country I am not clear in my mind whether for the purpose of the working journalists this Industrial Disputes Act will be operated by the Central Government or by the State Governments. Both the Central and the State Governments have their own machinery. From the Chief Labour Commission to the reconciliation Officer the Government of India has got a set of machinery throughout the country and again the State Governments have got their own Labour Commissioner and other officers. I want that also must be specifically provided in this Bill as to whether they have got to go to the Central Government or to the State Governments for the redress of their grievances. Now the tribunals are not permitted to undertake any case as soon as it is referred by either of the parties unless it is specifically ordered by the appropriate Government. Now my own opinion is this that for the time being it should be operated by the Labour Ministry of the Central Government. Neither the Information and Broadcasting Ministry nor the State Governments should operate this because it is a new thing incorporated by the Central Government and the Government of India knows what for they are coming forward with this piece of legislation. I want that the Information Ministry should hand over this business to the Labour Ministry which should operate this through its own machinery. Sir anyone who knows anything of journalism in this country will welcome the protection that this Bill gives to working journalists. There is no doubt that their present lot is a hard one and that it is difficult sometimes even for the best of them to discharge their duties honestly but the remarks made by my hon’ble friend make me anxious to understand the scope of the Bill. My hon’ble friend spoke of the protection given to editors who expressed their views freely even though they may be unpalatable to the proprietors of their papers. Sir is it really the object of the Bill to make the working journalists to decide the policy of the paper to which they are now attached?",
102: "Madam I rise to support the Railway Budget presented by Shri George Fernandes for the year 2010-11. Shri George Fernandes has his association with the Railways for the last 60 years as a labour leader. As a labour leader most of his energy was concentrated in making demands on behalf of the workers of the Railways. Now he has been put in a position to look after the affairs of the Railways as also the well-being of the workers who are working with the Railways. Since he is at the helm of affairs since he was a labour leader and his words carry weight with the workers I hope under his stewardship the workers of the Railways would perform better would do their jobs better and would see that the Railways perform better. In this way not only would the Railways satisfy the people who travel but also the functioning of the Railways in general would improve. The Indian Railways are the biggest network in the whole of Asia and the second largest in the world. Not only the Indian Railways are big in size but their problems are also big in proportion to their size and the things that the people want the Indian Railways to do for them are also big. Sir Mr. Fernandes on the 2nd of February had come out with a Status Paper wherein he has given the current position of the Indian Railways the problems that the Indian Railways are facing and also the innumerable demands including the demand for providing employment on a large scale in the Railways to the unemployed. I hope that in this discussion on the Railway Budget the participants would offer some constructive useful and practical suggestions. Mr. George Fernandes when he had to prepare and present this Budget had very little time to do that probably less than a hundred days. But even within that short period Sir he has come out with some new ideas with a new approach with regard to the functioning of the Railways. He has laid emphasis in the Budget on modernization on energy conservation and on computerization wherever it is necessary. Though he has expressed his helplessness in providing more jobs to the unemployed in the Railways he has tried to generate jobs outside the Railways with the help of the Railways. It may relate to afforestation and things like that. He has extended the computerization of bookings from the present four metropolitan cities to five more cities among which Bengaluru is included. Whenever an air accident takes place the compensation that is paid is very high. What Mr. Fernandes has done is that in the case of the railway accident also he has raised the amount of compensation from the present rate of one lakh rupees to two lakhs of rupees. In accidents whether it is the rail accident or air accident the loss of life is the same and any life lost can never be recovered. Another thing that is to be welcomed is that he is going to provide more accommodation and more seats to the Second Class passengers by gradually withdrawing the First Class A.C. coaches and the First Class coaches. I hope while withdrawing these facilities and extending them to the second class passengers the existing comforts and facilities of the second class passengers would further improve. I hope in all second class carriages cushion seats are going to be provided. Socialism is not levelling down but socialism is levelling up. When we withdraw facilities from the higher level the facilities for the lower level should be improved so that the travelling comforts for the lower level improve. Another innovative idea that Shri George Fernandes has thought of amidst the constraint of resources is financing the West Coast railway line which is popularly called the Konkan Railway line. This railway line was initiated when Prof. Madhu Dandavate was the Railway Minister about 12 years ago. Once that Government went out of power this scheme got put into cold storage. Of course in the last year’s Budget Shri Madhavrao Scindia had made some provision for construction of line from Mangalore to Udipi but the construction work did not start. Now Shri George Fernandes has come out with a novel idea of associating the States which are going to benefit out of it viz. Maharashtra Goa and Karnataka by raising certain contributions from these three States by raising certain contributions from the public and certain contributions from the Railways as well as from the General Exchequer. If this scheme had not been thought of and if this had not been taken up in the normal course and under the normal procedure this railway construction would have taken 15 years to complete. Now that a new method of financing this project has been initiated the Railway Minister has promised that construction of this railway line is going to be completed within five years. I wish that this scheme succeeds not that it succeeds for the sake of the Konkan Railway but this would open up a new era for taking up other essential constructions where those projects could not be taken up because of shortage of funds. I hope the Railway Minster who is a person of many ideas many innovative ideas would also think in terms of if possible self-financing schemes. Every year costs go up. Any project that is done today is cheaper than it would be tomorrow. He in his Status Paper has asked whether the money should come from the Central Government or whether it should come from the Railway Finance Corporation or from market borrowings where it is going to cost a little more. In any case I personally feel that these projects important projects should not lag behind on the ground of funds not coming from the Central Government or State Governments. Even if it is costly the money should be borrowed from the Railway Finance Corporation.",
103: "Mr. Deputy Chairman I think that it will be generally agreed that a Bill of this type is almost unavoidable at the present stage. There may be differences about some measures and also about the extent to which the Government proposes to go. That some fiscal control would be necessary at this stage when we are having development programmes on a very large scale a good part of which would be financed through deficit financing will I hope be uncontested. I think the fact that in the Eleventh Five Year Plan the greatest emphasis has been placed on heavy industries especially on the production of certain types of capital goods lends further force to an argument of this type. I am aware that the Eleventh Five Year Plan has also provided that there will be an expansion in consumption but I have no doubt that the greater emphasis on capital goods will result in at least a temporary shortage in consumer goods and this may lead to further inflationary pressures. To a certain extent such pressures have already been felt. The recent rise in prices is a kind of warning of the kind of situation that may develop unless we are careful from the very beginning. Therefore I would say that this measure of the Government in so far as I can understand it has a two-fold aim- on the one hand to increase the capacity of the Reserve Bank for creating money by note issue and on the other hand to put restrictions on the creation of credit by private banks. The first aim is intended to ensure that the money that is required for the economic development of the country will not be lacking. The second is to see that unregulated creation of credit by private scheduled banks will not create a situation whereby inflationary pressures would become too great. To that extent everybody would agree that a Bill of this type is unavoidable. I have however a few questions to ask of the hon’ble the Finance Minister and I have no doubt he will be able to meet the doubts which I have in my mind. My first doubt is whether there is not an undue measure of fear about these inflationary pressures. In the Eleventh Plan there is an uncovered gap of Rs.400 crores and there is also a proposal to have Rs.1200 crores of deficit financing and so we may say that deficit financing would be of the order of Rs.1600 crores because after all the uncovered portion has to be met somehow or the other. I do not know whether sufficient credit has been taken of a possible adverse trade balance which is bound to develop during the first two or three years of the Eleventh Five Year Plan. We are going to industrialise on a fairly heavy scale and as we import machinery on a large scale an adverse balance of trade is bound to develop. This adverse balance of trade will to a certain extent act as a check against any inflationary pressures. Then again there is the question of production of foodgrains and other materials within the country. Our economy is an expanding economy at the moment and I think that by the end of the first year of the Eleventh Plan or some time during the second year of the Eleventh Plan many of the measures which were undertaken during the Tenth Plan will start yielding results. Many of the major irrigation projects will give full dividends and the production of foodgrains in the country is bound to go up. As the production of foodgrains goes up within the country it will again be a check on inflationary pressures. Also some of the industries which were established during the Tenth Plan will start yielding results. From this point of view I would also like the hon’ble Finance Minister to consider whether the pattern of deficit financing which has been adopted in the Eleventh Five Year Plan is sound or may require some modification. To my mind it appears that the decision to put the maximum amount of deficit financing in the first year of the Eleventh Five Year Plan is not appropriate. Perhaps it would be a wiser thing to put the maximum amount in the second year of the Eleventh Five Year Plan because by that time the factors which I have mentioned just now will have come into operation. There will be more production of foodgrains within the country. Some of the results of industrialisation during the Tenth Five Year Plan will begin to be felt and as there will be a larger volume of commodities of every type in the country a larger dose of deficit financing in the second year of the Eleventh Five Year Plan may prove a more salutary measure than the decision to have the largest dose in the first year. There is another reason why I am a little apprehensive of having the biggest dose of deficit financing in the first year of the Eleventh Five Year Plan. If once the inflationary process starts if once there is any disturbance in the psychology of the market the results are difficult to foresee. If therefore in the first year of the Eleventh Plan we proceed a little more cautiously and have the biggest dose in the Eleventh year and perhaps a little less in the third and then start tightening up and reduce the deficit financing you will have three years the third fourth and the fifth of the Second Plan both to watch and to take such remedial measures as may be necessary. This is a suggestion which I would like the hon’ble Finance Minister to consider. I am mentioning it here because I think it has a definite relevance to the proposal he has made for currency expansion by doing away with the ratio between the gold bullion and the securities.",
104: "In recent months we have seen how speculation took place in regard to certain foodstuffs and other agricultural commodities. The Reserve Bank bulletins issued recently tell us that lots of money were advanced by a number of scheduled banks in order to back up the speculative operations and buyings of certain concerns. Similarly monies had been advanced for speculative purchasing with regard to other commodities. Such things are happening. But the point is that these speculations go on merrily in this country supported by those very elements who control the stock exchange and the financial world of our country. I should like to know to what extent this is going to be stopped. It is said that we are in a bad situation and in order to give a proper direction to the planned development of the country it is essential to direct the investments and speculative investments in particular. How much this measure conforms to these I should like to know from the Government. It appears to me that not very much will have come out of this measure notwithstanding the fact that Government is armed with these powers. It is of vital importance today that we should have proper control of our investments that are taking place or cornering of shares in some cases. If we are at all serious about the planned development of our economy in general and our industry and commerce in particular I am afraid the powers that are being taken by the Government under this Bill are not at all sufficient for ensuring such developments as would enable the Government to direct investment and control transfer of shares etc. In conformity with the interests of planned economic development. This is what I find from the reading of this Bill and even from hearing the speech that has been delivered by the hon’ble Minister. I have also read the other speech he had made in the other House. That does not throw much light on the subject. I am not surprised because when the whole thing was being discussed and mooted by the Government the approach of the Government suffered from certain deficiencies. That is to say they were not so much keen on suppressing wholesale the speculative operations as on getting a certain measure of control over them. Today the time has come for making up one’s mind with regard to the speculation business as a whole. This is the most important thing. With regard to investment it has been said very eloquently in these documents that after all a person should have an opportunity of investing his funds and therefore he should have a chance of going to the market and buying some shares. I can understand it but what is the protection against his being cheated by certain people who have taken command of the stock exchange? What is the guarantee against that? Blank transfer is there it is not. Forward trading is there. Contract is provided for. It is not abolished. Also there are other ways and means of cheating the common man. As we find today the common man goes in for investment. Very genuinely he goes in for investing because he wants to save some money for bad days. Now what is the protection in this Bill which would save his money? I find that there is no such effective guarantee. I should have thought that in considering this whole scheme of measures the Government would be interested in seeing as to how the heart of speculative operation could be crushed namely the monopolists who control the stock exchange today. It is essential to hound them out of the field altogether. In Kolkata they not only put up an outward show but they have built under-world and I suppose that under-world exists even today. A police raid took place. Telephone system and the whole paraphernalia was discovered which showed that certain big men in the stock exchanges were carrying on sub-terannean business. This is a new type of under-world we have in our country in order to cheat the common man in order to evade taxes in order to carry on profiteering and blackmarket trades. Lots of things came to light that day and the newspapers gave a lot of publicity. We came across certain very big people. Some of them are very well-known patrons of the Congress Party the ruling Party who were hauled up in this fashion. What has happened to them we would like to know when we discuss such a measure. They are the kings in the speculation world; they are the tycoons of that field. I would like to know what has happened to such people. What are you going to do with these speculators? Will they be allowed to operate openly or secretly in the field under this fashion or are you really thinking of taking some action against them not merely for apprehending those people who have gone underground and started underground business in this manner but also the possible recruits to that under-world I would like to know. This is what the Government should tell us. It is no use trying to bring in all technical questions explaining one clause after another. This is important but what we would like to know from the Government is how you are going to check these elements who sit on top of the country as far as the stock-exchange is concerned. These are very big and powerful people and they need to be suppressed with a heavy hand in the interests of our economy. I find the hon’ble Minister piloting this Bill is completely indifferent to that aspect of the matter. There have been cases where a person—a speculator so to say – goes in for heavy purchases at one time. The heavy pressure boosts up the prices. Then he starts selling it thereby realizing the money he had spent for buying certain shares in the market.",
105: "This Bill has been introduced in this House in pursuance of the recommendations of the Press Commission. Hon’ble Members might remember that the Commission have devoted some part of its observations to this question of having a schedule which will regulate the price of newspapers according to the pages that they contain. Some of the points that the Commission have made are relevant here and might help hon’ble Members is considering the Bill more carefully and also examining the grounds on which this recommendation has been so emphatically made by the Press Commission. The Commission says in para 205 that in the present newspaper industry of this country papers of long standing which have been able to build up a large and stable volume of advertisement revenue are in a very advantageous position as compared to others who have just entered the field. It is true that such economic advantages and handicaps exist in a number of industries but their presence in the newspaper is not in our opinion conducive to the even and healthy development of the Press. Newspapers serve as media for the free exchange of information and of ideas. The proper functioning of democracy requires that every individual should have equal opportunity in so far as this can be achieved to put forward his opinion. I have just given a few extracts from the Commission’s report in order to explain the underlying idea of the Commission. The main aim of the Commission’s recommendation is to see that a fair price is guaranteed to independent small papers and thus enable them to resist competition from bigger and richer papers. It is also to protect such papers against unfair price competition such as exists in other industrial commodities like cornering price-cutting etc. It is the Commission’s contention that though such practices might be tolerated within a certain limit in other industries it should not be so in the press industry where we have the medium of expression of public opinion and where cornering by a person or a group of persons of this medium would mean the passing of this medium into the hands of a few persons and their monopolizing the medium of public opinion and throttling the expression of opinion by others who would like to place their views before the public. This in their opinion would be practically amounting to a denial of the freedom of expression and it is in that light that they have made this recommendation. The Commission have said that they have examined many schemes as to how it would be possible to ensure the largest amount of freedom of expression and they felt that this was probably one of the most effective ways by which we can ensure freedom of expression. I would like here to mention that when the Commission’s report came out the Government had discussions regarding those recommendations; and the recommendation regarding price page schedules was also one of those important recommendations which were discussed with a number of organisations which were concerned with the newspaper industry. The All India Newspaper Editors Conference the Indian Federation of Working Journalists the Indian Eastern Newspapers Society the Indian Language Newspapers’ Association and also a large number of individual newspaper editors and proprietors were consulted. This discussion took place many times and the pros and cons of this question were thoroughly discussed. We found that the majority of the members were very much in favour of some such legislation and restriction. There is no doubt that some of the papers were against it. But that was to be expected. Afterwards came the debate in Parliament on the Press Commission’s Report and Government found that in the discussion in both the Houses there was a very strong opinion—I would say a strong majority opinion—that some such legislation on the lines of the recommendations of the Press Commission should be undertaken by the Government. Here I would like to mention one or two things regarding the question of the price page schedule and the pros and cons of the advantages or disadvantages of a schedule. The points in favour of the schedule might be considered briefly. It will tend to equalize competition and also prevent the emergence of monopolies. Secondly it will also relax the control of big advertising interests on newspapers and in that sense generally make them more independent. Thirdly the creation of monopolies and the cornering of large numbers of page papers by one or two or three groups impinges on the Fundamental Right of freedom of expression and by trying to restrict such practices we will in reality be giving greater scope for freedom of expression that we can now. These were the main things which we had in view in the discussions with the newspaper interests. However in discussing the details of the price page schedule a number of points cropped up and we had also before us all the arguments that could be put forward against the schedule. We certainly carefully considered all of them. One of the points which was brought forward was that this was something quite new and was therefore likely to create a very unfavourable press and unfavourable reactions regarding our country in the international world. It might be even spread abroad that India is restricting the freedom of the Press. Now regarding this point I do not think it will be correct to say that no such restriction exists. Even today and formerly on a greater scale in Great Britain the price-page schedule existed and exists. No doubt the object of it might be quite different. The object is to give a more equitable distribution of newsprint but the control by a statutory corporation of the distribution of newsprint only to papers if they follow certain price-page regulations is there and has been functioning for the last fifteen years or more. In this country during the war and immediately after we had the schedule for a number of years.",
106: "Before the Joint select Committee as also in the Lok Sabha very strong arguments were advanced and it was said that something more should be done than what had been proposed at present in the case of linguistic minorities. This they wanted done by the insertion of a particular provision in the Constitution. It would be clear to hon’ble Members when the Constitution (Ninth Amendment) Bill is taken into consideration. The States Reorganisation Commission have also dealt with this question and have suggested that the minorities should not be allowed to develop a separatist tendency; they should not ask for a state within a state or something else incompatible with their citizenship of that particular State. Still it is essential especially where there are linguistic minorities that some proper safeguards should be evolved. For that purpose certain provisions have to be included in the Constitution. Now some Members of the Joint Select Committee in particular were not happy; they desired that something more should be done and in particular they were anxious that these safeguards should be statutorily recognised that is either they should be placed in the States Reorganisation Bill itself or in the Constitution. That question was considered by the Home Ministry and we have already sent out to the various State Governments a circular a copy of which was placed before the Joint Select Committee. This circular has been published along with the Report of the Joint Select Committee. In that hon’ble Members will find that certain safeguards have been suggested regarding middle or high schools regarding concessions in respect of administrative matters etc. It was suggested that the Governor ought to have some powers of making enquiries into these matters. The Governor also will be making enquiries in the light of the amendment that has been proposed in the Constitution (Ninth Amendment) Bill. It was further contended that it would not be sufficient unless we have got statutory safeguards. So far as these statutory safeguards are concerned it was considered that it would not be advisable in the interests of the linguistic minorities themselves to have these safeguards. What is most important is that though certain rights have to be safeguarded to the minorities they have to develop a sense of oneness and harmony with the rest of the population and the rest of the population also should not believe that these people have got separatist tendencies. If certain statutory safeguards were introduced it was felt that they would lead rather to the worsening of the good relations between the linguistic minorities and others than to any improvement. Therefore all that could be done was to sent out a circular to the State Governments pointing out broadly the main features of such safeguards with the desire that they should protect or safeguard the interests of the minorities to the extent possible subject to the reservations that I have already pointed out. It was also suggested that just as we have in the case of the Scheduled castes and the tribes a commissioner appointed by the Government who goes to the various States finds out the position and then makes a recommendation or a report which is considered by the Government of India the State Governments and others there ought to be a separate officer for the purpose of finding out the position so far as the linguistic minorities are concerned. On behalf of the Government an assurance was given that this question would be duly considered by the Government of India and if they find that the appointment of such an officer would be useful to the interests of the linguistic minorities then such an officer would be appointed. However I would point out that so far as statutory guarantees are concerned I would desire that these guarantees should not be insisted upon because after all we have to develop a sense of oneness. In any State and every State there are bound to be linguistic minorities and their attempt ought to be to completely harmonise themselves with the majority community. The majority community has also to be generous so far as the legitimate rights of these people are concerned. So this process of mental approach towards each other would perhaps be halted or at least adversely affected if such guarantees are given. We would then think more and more of the guarantees and of the enforcement of these guarantees through the courts of law or otherwise. This will result in the relations getting embittered and will be harmful to the ultimate interests of the nation. This is what might be found to a certain extent in the State Reorganisation Bill. This question will be considered at a greater length when the Constitution (Ninth Amendment) Bill comes before the House for consideration. So far as the services are concerned some attempts have been made to lay down the general principles. There are only two all-India services namely the I.A.S. and the I.P.S. These are the only two all-India services and what has been decided is that there would be fresh cadres so far as the new States are concerned and officers would be transferred from one cadre to another after taking all the relevant circumstances into account e.g. the requirements of the States and also the work that these officers had carried on. That process would be completed after the work is started. The work has to go on and the process would be complete as early as possible. So far as the State services are concerned certain principles have been laid down. One such principle is that in the case of a whole State merging with another bigger State all the officers at various levels will be carried over into that State. The difficulty arises when you have to deal with the question of the transfer of certain portions of a territory to one State and another portion to other States as in the case of Andhra Pradesh and as in the case of Maharashtra.",
107: "Mr. Deputy Chairman I have to thank hon’ble Members for the kind words that they have said about the Government in the course of the discussion this afternoon. This is an occasion of more than ordinary significance. The political history of India had many vicissitudes and this particular day will be remembered as placing another milestone in our progress towards an ideal State. There have naturally been many storms and we have had to pass through considerable stress and strain. Yet it is a great pleasure to me to tender my felicitations to the hon’ble Members of the House. During the last ten and a half months the country had been resounding with the echoes of the States Reorganization Commission the proposals made by it the various claims put forward by individual groups and Government and the comments and criticisms made by innumerable persons from the press from the public platforms from the floor of the Legislatures and ultimately from the floor of the two Houses of Parliament itself. It is a matter of gratification I would submit almost one of unique character that in spite of all the vicissitudes through which this Bill had to pass ultimately the form which it has assumed and which represents the fruits of the collective wisdom of the two Houses of Parliament has the support almost the unanimous support of both the Houses. I would like hon’ble Members just to place before themselves the picture of the new map of India. So far we had a large number of States; perhaps there were 20 States besides some other territories but now we will have only 14 States and four territories besides the Andamans the Nicobars and the Laccadives. The citizens of this country will be living in the States and only less than two per cent or just near about one per cent will be living in the centrally administered areas. It is worth considering now whether we have not really succeeded in evolving a scheme of which we all can well be proud. If hon’ble Members will consider the case of each individual State they will find that almost unanimity had been reached except in the case of Ahmedabad in Gujarat. If you take one State after another you will find that almost all people in the country have now accepted the scheme that is contained in this Bill. If you take the various States you will see that Tamil Nadu Andhra Kerala Punjab Rajasthan and other States have virtually accepted the scheme contained in this Bill. It is unfortunate that there has been some amount of difference in Ahmedabad in regard to the Bilingual State of Bombay which was introduced in this Bill with the unanimous support of the Members of the Lok Sabha and I hope with the backing of most of the Members of the Rajya Sabha if not of all of them. I do not want on this occasion to enter into petty controversies. This is too big an occasion to admit of any trivial points by way of debate or otherwise. It is my confirmed opinion that the country has succeeded in achieving results which will prove to be of an enduring character and which will take it forward on the road to progress prosperity and to absolute security and safety. The unity of India will indeed be helped by the rational distribution of the territories of the country. There has been a long-standing hankering on the part of large multitudes that their areas should be reorganised. It was but proper that the Government should have appointed a States Reorganisation Commission to deal with that matter. The Commission worked very hard and made their recommendations. We are obliged to the Commission for the thought that they bestowed on the ticklish and knotty problem. Well there were certain matters to which the Government had to give further consideration though they had always been anxious to translate into concrete form what emanated from the Commission. Whatever changes have been made have been I believe for the better and they have made the entire scheme more acceptable. The Bill that was placed before the House was certainly placed with the approval of and at the instance of the Cabinet. All that was done in the regular way. I do not want to go into details nor do I consider it necessary to make any retort about what might have been said because as I said this is too solemn an occasion for such an operation. I may also observe that we have no fault to find with anybody. Everyone whether individuals or those who had an opportunity of working together tried his utmost tried to the maximum extent he could to achieve what he thought to be in the best interests of the country. Well some things had not been as perfect as one would have liked them to be. We tried to improve them to the extent we could and we respected public opinion and we were guided by it. So far as the bilingual Bombay State is concerned I believe that everybody accepts that it is an ideal solution for Bombay. Without being unfair no one can find fault with Government for having agreed to accept a proposal which I think 99 per cent in the country is considered to be the best solution to this very ticklish and almost insoluble problem which had engaged the attention of this and also of the other House continuously for days and days and for weeks and weeks. I am glad that today the scheme that we have has the backing the goodwill the blessing and the support of the entire people in the country. There may have been some errors there may have been some aberrations. Well that is unavoidable in human affairs; but after all man learns by mistakes and wisdom is ultimately the result of the lessons learnt from a series of mistakes that are committed.",
108: "Sir our Constitution has also emphasized this composite character of our culture. The language which is going to be the official language of the Indian Union—it has been laid down in the Constitution—will reflect the diversity of our composite culture. There is no attempt anywhere at establishing uniformity. From this point of view the attempt to re-organise the States recognizing the differences which exist is a move in the right direction. It is a wise and a statesmanlike move. The essence of statesmanship is not to do something according to a formula. Something may be ideal on paper but when we face certain facts the essence of statesmanship is to face those facts and to recognise the differences or the diversities or the difficulties which exist and then to find a solution in which these difficulties these diversities and these differences may be reconciled. The present Bill takes a further step in that direction but my regret is that this Bill did not form part of the States Reorganisation Bill. If the proposals contained in this Bill had been presented as a part of the general proposals in the State Reorganisation Bill perhaps this extra attention which has been paid to the particular problems discussed in this Bill would not have been given. So much time and attention would have been consumed over this question if we were dealing with a larger number of problems. When we look into the totality of the situation in India we look at the problems in a general way but when we isolate one particular problem from the general totality of the picture and look at only one isolated problem there is always a risk there is always a danger that we might exaggerate the importance of some particular items. One of the reasons why there has been so much discussion over this rather small Bill as the hon’ble Home Minister described it is because it has been isolated from the general picture of the reorganisation of Indian States. With regard to the particular proposals which have been made Sir I do not wish to speak at length at this late stage. These are in essence the result of discussions and shall I say if not complete agreement at least the reduction to a minimum of the differences which existed between the different groups. The various demands and counter –demands of the different States that use of the term ‘State’ in this connection is somewhat unfortunate. If we had talked of Provinces instead of States there would have been less of feeling on this issue but be that as it may these demands of the different States have been before the country for a number of years. After a great deal of discussion over this particular Bill we have come to what may be regarded as more or less agreed settlements. The Bengal Governments had made certain demands; the Bihar Government had made certain demands. Perhaps in a case like this it would have been better if these demands had not been made publicly in that particular manner. It might have been better if the Governments had discussed it among themselves but whatever that be the States Reorganisation Commission took into consideration all the recommendations all the demands all the claims and counter-claims of the different States and they made certain recommendations with regard to the transfer of certain territories from Bihar to Bengal in the northern region and certain territories from West Bengal to Bihar. So far as the territories in the north are concerned unfortunately as the hon’ble Home Minister stated today also there was a defect in the proposal of the States Reorganisation Commission but my hon’ble friend Pandit Kunzru who is absent today made it very clear in his speech before the House that mistake had arisen because the Commission had been given certain defective maps. The idea of the Commission throughout was to suggest the redistribution of the territories in the northern region in such a way that West Bengal may become one compact State. They had made the particular recommendation which they made partly because one of the rivers in that region is continually shifting its channel and partly because defective maps had been used. And Pandit Kunzru in his speech before this House left no doubt in the matter that if the correct maps had been before them they would have framed their recommendations in a manner which would have ensured that West Bengal was one compact State. As regards the needs of the compact State I do not have to add anything after what was said by the hon’ble Home Minister to-day; for administrative purposes it is essential that a State must be a compact unit because otherwise with regard to the problem of law and order with regard to the problem of movement of goods particularly with regard to the smuggling of materials and goods from India into Pakistan in this border region a State divided into two different units with another State intervening in between would face all kinds of difficulties. Now Sir my hon’ble friend who spoke last also agreed that there should be a compact State of West Bengal but he asked why should the boundary of this compact State be 200 yards to the West of the National Highway? Now Sir it is obvious that if you are going to make it a compact State that area which connects the two disjointed parts must be of such a size that it is a practicable proposition. You can theoretically give only 100 yards all along the Pakistan frontier but obviously such a transfer of territory would not serve any purpose whatever. Now a suggestion has been made that the National Highway with an area of about 200 yards to the west of it would be the boundary line in order to ensure proper arrangements for the maintenance of the road and also for the proper vigilance.",
109: "There are many important records that are left in the hands of various organization of the country such as the municipalities the corporations the different commercial organisations of the country the Chambers of Commerce etc. As has been mentioned by some hon’ble Members here some are also lying in private hands. The Government of India cannot be held responsible for the management and preservation of these records until Parliament passes the necessary legislation declaring these records as records of national importance. Under these circumstances we presume that the Resolution of the hon’ble Member covers only those records which lie in the custody of the Government of India the archives of India and the different Ministries of the Central Government. It is true that some of the records are also lying with the State Governments on loan. Sir these records in my opinion can be divided into three groups. The first group is the records which are owned by the Government of India which are created by the Government of India by the different Ministries of the Government of India. The second group is the records which have been presented to the Archives of India as are the Bhopal records. The records of the Bhopal Government the former Bhopal Government have been presented to the Archives of India; and the third category is of those records which are purchased by the Indian Archives. There is of course the fourth variety as has been pointed out by my hon’ble friend the mover of the Resolution that a large number of records of the Central Government are lying with the State Governments. These records have been given on loan to the State Governments because they are connected with the administration of those States. They are necessary for carrying out the day-to-day administration of those States. That is why it has not been thought proper to take away those records from the States. They are lying with the States but the proprietorship the ownership rests with the Government of India. Sir one thing I may impress upon this House. Although all these records are proprieties of the Government of India they belong to Government of India and they are managed by the Government of India although legally speaking they are managed by the Government of India by executive action factually speaking they are not so. There is the organization to which a reference has been made by my hon’ble friends the Indian Historical Records Commission. This Commission is there to give its guidance and expert advice to the Government of India for the maintenance of these records. Sir my hon’ble friend the mover of this Resolution is thoroughly acquainted with this organization because he happens to be a member of that organization. Sir the Indian Historical Records Commission is a body set up by a Resolution of the Government of India in the year 1919. The functions and authority of the Commission have been made clear in the Resolution itself. This Indian Historical Records Commission which supervises and guides the activities of the Archives of India and the management of Indian Government records is a consultative and advisory body but the vast majority of members of this body are drawn from sources other than the Government of India. The present constitution of the Indian Historical Records Commission is: The Minister of Education the Secretary of the Education Ministry the Director of Archives and five members nominated by the Government of India. In addition to that there are 25 representatives of the 25 State Government of this country. There are 27 representatives of the 27 universities of India. There are 12 representatives of the twelve top-ranking research institutions of this country. Actually Government servants if we can call them are only three the Minister of Education the Secretary of the Education Ministry and the Director of Archives. Five members are nominated by Government. The rest are drawn from other sources. This is the body Sir that has been appointed under the Resolution of the Government of India to give expert advice for the management of these matters. Sir the body has got two other adjuncts the Research and Publication Committee which looks after the research and publications of the Indian Archives and the Local Records Sub-Committee which looks after the transference of records from their parent bodies that is their creative agencies the different Ministries of the Government of India to the Archives. Then this body the Local Records Sub-Committee also looks after indexing and cataloguing of the records and thirdly weeding of the records also. So what I am labouring to impress upon the hon’ble Members of this House is that in every step every activity of the Indian Archives the Government of India is guided by some expert bodies. Sir the Indian Historical Records Commission meets once in every year and they survey scrutinise and examine in great detail the activities of the Archives of India. Perhaps the ground they have covered during the last few years the subjects upon which they have made recommendations will convince this honourable House about the interest that is taken by this body. Sir the Indian Historical Records Commission have advised the Government of India during the last few years about matters relating to the regional survey committee establishment of record offices in India classification of historical documents and inspection of records preservation of archives. These are only a few of the many aspects of the activities of the Indian Archives that have been surveyed and upon which recommendations have been made by the Indian Historical Records Commission during the last few years. Sir I do not want to say that all the recommendations that have been made by the Indian Historical Records Commission have been implemented by the Government of India but what I do say Sir is that barring a few which could not be implemented either on financial grounds or for other reasons.",
110: "Mr. Vice-Chairman I wish to make a few observations of a general nature on the Appropriation Bill. I know that this is an Appropriation Bill and not the Finance Bill but perhaps it is permissible to make a reference to the policies which underlie this Bill. The Bill in its broad feature is having regard to all the circumstances that prevail in this country a reasonable measure and deserving all the support of this House. We were left behind two hundred years back in the struggle for life. The industrial revolution by passed us. We are now in the atomic age and we have somehow or other if we wish to exist as a decent country in the world to make up for lost time. We have to provide for our people a higher standard of living and that higher standard of living we can provide only by increasing production and increased production involves increased expenditure. You cannot have increased expenditure without heavy taxation and it is inevitable therefore that the tendency to tax more and more should increase with the expansion of State’s activities. We wish to usher in a socialist economy. Let us be clear as to what we mean by a socialist economy. We have heard a great deal about the private sector and the public sector. Well we have got a mixed system of economy and suppose we have to be fair to the private sector. But there is just one thing about it that you must be clear about. In a socialist economy the direction of investment and the control of investment must rest in the hands of the State. In a socialist economy the public sector must dominate the private sector. All this is vital for a socialist economy. I was glad for that reason to find as an ordinary citizen who was engaging himself in legal studies that we have nationalised life insurance. I hope we shall maintain and continue that policy. I can see no alternative to expansion of State activity in all directions that concerns the common man. It is only in some such way that we shall be able to provide employment to our hungry millions. Of course it does not mean that every tax is a good tax. As one who rather likes to be described as a socialist I have a little objection to indirect taxation. I think the better way to deal with the problem of taxation is to tax those who are in a position to bear the burden of taxation. We find the richer classes always saying that the taxation is very heavy. Even if the taxation was moderate they would say it was heavy. But it is extra ordinary that when once a tax of a direct nature has been levied the industry is able ultimately to adjust itself to the conditions imposed by the tax and therefore we have to do a little dynamic thinking in these matters. It does not mean that every item of taxation is a right item. Personally I agree with my hon’ble friend that a tax on salt or a tax on foodgrains is not perhaps an ideal tax. It is not a right tax and it should be levied if it has to be levied at all with extreme moderation but my general point of view is that I would favour more direct taxation and less indirect taxation. May I just say that planning needs trained personnel? We cannot in the twentieth century compete with the advanced countries of the world without trained personnel and it is for that reason I am a little worried as one who has been connected with education for well over 35 years in my State about the rapid fall in our university standards. Now I speak with some knowledge of this question. I have been connected as an Examiner with many Indian Universities. I know them; I am in contact with our young men and it is very painful for me to find that they are not able to express themselves today in any language whatever. It is not as if they are able to express themselves very well in Hindi. I should be happy if they were able to express themselves well in Hindi but the distressing feature is that the vast majority of our students are not well up in their studies and the tragedy is that they are not able to express themselves in any language properly. Of course there is overcrowding in the universities. I am not complaining against this overcrowding and I think education is the birth-right of every student. I visualize a time when education in all its aspects will be as free as the air that we breather. The only thing that we should require or we should demand is the capacity to profit by higher education. Higher education must not be made too expensive for the poor. After all the unfortunate section of the community has a right to a better deal but what I am worried about is the fall in standards. We cannot ignore the claims of expansion and there has been a considerable expansion of secondary education in our State. I think it is right that there should be this expansion. The question however is how are we going to reconcile the claims of expansion with the claims of efficiency. I am all in favour of diversification of our educational system but by mere diversification of education you will not be able to solve the problem of employment among the educated unemployed. You will merely substitute a class of specialist unemployed for the general unemployed today. How are you going to tackle this problem? I think it is unnecessary for us to insist upon uniformity of standards in all our higher educational institutions in the country. The view has also been put forward by the Ministry that there should be uniformity of standards in all the universities.",
111: "Then Sir reference was made to some Audit Report. That is how the Lady Member started. She said that the Defence Ministry was not doing its job quite well. There was over provisioning there were lapses and so on and so forth. She also said that the money which could have been spent for very many beneficial projects was locked up in the Defence estimates and was ultimately given back. Now as a matter of curiosity I think mostly on the Audit Report which dealt with the accounts of 1953-54 namely two years back and which dealt with many cases which arose in the years 1950 1951 and 1952 when conditions were not normal. We were then just recovering from the effects of the Second World War and these cases of over provisioning came up before the Audit. Now these are the points which have been raised in this Audit Report. As you are aware Sir there is a Public Accounts Committee whose main function is to go into the details of all these matters and to examine them. I am told that the Public Accounts Committee is at present engaged in the task of going into all these questions and taking steps to see whether the comments made by the Auditor General are satisfied or not and whether there is a sufficient explanation forthcoming or not. The Public Accounts Committee has also got to devise the steps so that those irregularities should not occur and there should be no over provisioning. I may say one thing in passing because it will rather be tedious for me to take the House through the merits of each particular thing in detail. Please remember that there is no question of over provisioning. Whenever an estimate is made the Finance Ministry takes very great care to see that there is no over provisioning. Sometimes it so happens that the money is not spent for certain reasons. For example we may have got to pay Rs.5 crores for a certain equipment which may have been ordered from abroad and which may be due to be delivered in the financial year that is to say in 1956-57. But when the dates of deliveries approach the contractors or the suppliers may ask for a little extension of time and the result is that instead of the goods being delivered by March 1957 they may be delivered in May 1957 or in July 1957. This may result in the money being held back. Now such things do happen but that does not indicate and lapse on our part or any mistake on our part. Similarly sometimes it happens like this. In the beginning say in October 1955 we find that something is necessary and we hope that the whole process of placing the contract and providing funds and everything else will be gone through and we will be able to get the deliveries by the end of the year. But negotiations take a lot of time the contract is signed much later than we had imagined it could be signed and the result is that the goods are not forthcoming by the end of the year and the money is held back. So that may occur but that does not indicate any fault or any deliberate over provisioning on the part of the Defence Ministry. It would be stupid to do so. Why should we do so? There is no motive for that. My hon’ble Friend referred particularly to one item of Rs.2 crores recoverable from the Central Ministries and the State Governments. Now I went into all the details and I found that most of this money was under recovery from the Central Government and the State Governments. It pertained to certain buildings and other premises which had been rented out to the State Governments for rehabilitation purposes and some other purposes but the rents had not been realized. This amount of Rs. 2 crores represents the rents to be realized. Now I submit Sir that the House should take this assurance from me that we are most anxious to prepare our estimates as accurately as possible and on the basis that the money estimated should be spent. In the Defence Ministry we have got a Financial Adviser who keeps a strict watch over these things. My hon’ble Friend said that we were spending 50 per cent. As a matter of exactitude that is not quite correct. I think if you only take the revenues then it may be about 40 to 41 per cent. But that makes no difference because if any necessity arises I am sure that Parliament would provide all the necessary funds. So it is not 50 per cent; it is substantially much less than that. Then there was some reference made about the structure and there was some comment what about the establishment of an Army Council? Now this is really a reference to the structure which exists in the United Kingdom. I am not saying anything about the official structure there. Probably it is very good. But so far as we in India are concerned we went into this matter and we came to the conclusion that our existing structure performed really the same functions. As you are aware Sir for the purpose of deciding high policy matters we have got the Defence Committee of the Cabinet presided over by the Prime Minister. It is not confined to the Cabinet Ministers or a few of them but the Heads of the three Services namely the Chief of the Army Staff the Chief of the Air Staff and all other senior officers.",
112: "Mr. Deputy Chairman I give my support to the Bill. The Bill carries out one of the major recommendations of the Bhore Committee on Health Survey and Development of which I was a member. Now one of the objects of this will be to provide an All-India Institute for the advancement of medical knowledge and the training of medical personnel. It will provide refresher courses for the physicians working in our towns and villages. It will provide I take it facilities for higher instruction in modern medicine. I think the Health Minister if I may say so with respect was a little far too apologetic in defence of modern medicine. We don’t stand today where we did four thousand years back when our ancestors had creative minds and did a very great deal in the world of medicine. The world has moved far ahead during those four thousand years and if you want to benefit by medicine or by the facilities which medical science offers you must be prepared to go to doctors who have knowledge of physiology bacteriology pathology and who can perform the various tests which are necessary in order to diagnose diseases. There is a very great deal that can be done by way of research. Now I should have liked some more light to be thrown on the organizational side of the Institute. One of the questions which we had to consider was whether this Institute should not be affiliated to the Delhi University or to any other University for that matter. We came to the conclusion that it should serve it should function as an autonomous institution having more or less the status of a university. But I do not on reflection like this segregation in education. The tendency to have special institutes and call them by name of universities or to devolve on them the functions of university has I am afraid been carried a little too far in this country. We have an engineering university and we have I suppose a technological institute. Should they call themselves universities? Now a university is a place where knowledge is integrated. It is a place where you have researchers and professors of various branches of knowledge working and cooperating together for the advancement of learning. It is an advantage to have a big institution of a specialized character affiliated to a university. I wish therefore that a decision had been taken to affiliate it to the Delhi University which I believe is a Federal University and if necessary the constitution of the Delhi University could have been modified for that purpose. Another thing that I would like to say is this. I have gone through the Bill and I find that far too much has been left to be filled up by the rules to be made by the Executive Government. Now by merely reading the Bill I can have no idea as to how the Institute will actually function and what the measure of internal autonomy will be that the Institute will possess. In a note which I had the honour of appending to the Report of the Bhore Committee we emphasized that the institution must not be allowed to develop in such a manner as to become a place for mutual admiration. We wanted therefore provisions to be specifically made in the constitution for an external element on the academic bodies of the institution. Now I think that the Institute will have four representatives of the medical faculties of Indian universities to be nominated by the Central Government in the manner prescribed by rules. But the Institute is not a medical faculty. The Institute will have a governing body and there will be many other bodies which will work as part of the Institute. What I have in mind is that on the academic bodies which will frame the curricula and which will be responsible for the conduct of examination and for prescribing all the standards there should be representation of an expert character provided in the Constitution itself. I should like Mr. Deputy Chairman The position to be clarified in this respect by the Health Minister. What is the intention of the Government in regard to this matter? How do they propose to constitute the bodies which will be responsible for the framing of the curricula for prescribing the courses and for the laying down of academic standards and how do they propose to maintain a liaison between this Institute and various medical bodies in the country? I think that at least we should have been given some information on this aspect of the matter because I find that almost everything is going to be left to rules which are going to be framed hereafter and we have no clear picture before us as to how this Institute will function. That it is desirable to have this Institute will be admitted. It is becoming increasingly difficult for our young men to get facilities for higher education in the bigger universities of western countries. Those universities have their own problems. They have got to think of providing for their own young men first and it is essential that we should have an Institute in this country of a very high character where it is possible for research to be carried on under almost ideal conditions. We do not want to lag behind in the race for knowledge in the modern world so far as knowledge and research are concerned. While we have produced eminent physicians and while we have produced good practicing surgeons it is a matter for regret that our output so far as medical research is concerned is poor. There are some people who have research to their credit that one reason for the lack of output in research is that the abler physicians in our medical institutions are allowed private work. They devote too much time to private practice. I have known professors of pathology and anatomy.",
113: "This Resolution as I find it has two parts. The first part relates to an enquiry into the monopolistic hold of foreign owned and foreign controlled advertising agencies in India. The second part is in regard to the desirability of Government taking advantage of Indian advertising firms in relation to its advertisement of nationalized concerns railways and so forth. In so far as the first part is concerned I do not think that is necessary and I do not think that we have any need to enquire into the working of foreign owned and foreign controlled advertising agency firms. So long as it is the policy of Government to permit foreigners to operate in this country I do not think that if there is a private sector they should be subject to frequent enquiries. In so are as this part of the Resolution is concerned I am afraid I cannot accord it my support. But in so far as the second part of the Resolution is concerned there is absolutely no conflict between my head and heart in giving my full support to that part of this Resolution. It is difficult for me to adduce arguments in support of this very desirable proposition as I do not know what arguments could be advanced against it. I should have liked very much Dr. Keskar to speak first if he were opposed to it because I think that any reasonable person should support it. But the likely objections may be these and I am trying to analyse them. First it might be stated that it might mean discrimination. But I do not think that argument holds water because there is no question of discrimination involved. Government have gone out in different fields of activity in assisting and furthering Indian participation progressive Indianisation of Services and so forth. Even in the tea industry I believe the Government is trying to break the monopoly of foreign tea broking firms by supporting the rise of Indian firms in the tea broking business which is a very specialized and a kind of monopolistic business. So I do not think that Dr. Keskar would advance that argument at all because that is a preposterous argument. The second argument may be that we have not firms of sufficient quality and standard. Now let us first examine whether that proposition is true. I submit that that proposition is not quite true although in reply to a question by the mover of the Resolution the hon’ble Minister for Information and Broadcasting did say that they sometimes find themselves in difficulty when they had entrusted advertising business to Indian firms. Now I do not know if you are aware that one of the most important advertisements that appear in papers is that of the Tea Board and that advertisement is I think by an Indian agency. I do not think that anybody here would contend that the art quality attained by the firm which is entrusted with this advertisement work is in any way inferior to the work done by any of the foreign agencies because every one of us has seen the advertisements of tea. And as for myself I can say that I am perfectly satisfied with the quality of work done by that firm. Now if that is so then it cannot be contended that there are no Indian firms of adequate standard and quality. The question then may be asked that there are not sufficient numbers of such Indian firms. And if there are not sufficient numbers then all the advertisements could not probably be entrusted to them to be properly handled. On that I have not I am afraid sufficient information. Probably the hon’ble Minister knows better as to how many Indian firms there are who can compare favourably or who are probably better than foreign advertising firms. But to the extent that there are there can be no argument that so far as Government advertising work is concerned it should be entrusted to such firms. I understand that these Indian advertising agency firms had met Government and they were given certain assurances. And I find that the Ministry of Production had subsequent to the meeting issued directives to all corporation under its control to make use of Indian advertising agencies. I should have thought that that directive would have been based on an appreciation of the work that could be performed by the Indian advertising agency firms. But the surprising part of it is that even thereafter many public undertaking like NEPA mills and the new nationalized Insurance Corporations have entrusted their work to foreign agencies. This certainly is surprising. I had said just now that a question might be asked as to whether there were sufficient firms of requisite standard available to handle all the work. If there are not I believe that there is a duty cast upon Government to create conditions so that an adequate number of firms of the requisite standard may come up. Everybody is aware that advertising is a specialized job. Then there should be provision for the training of personnel. I find in the memorandum which the Indian Advertising Agency firms submitted to the Government that they had also made certain proposals in this regard. I should very much like to know if Government has taken any action in this regard because it is desirable that Indian personnel should be trained to equip themselves for this highly specialized work. But so far as the Resolution is concerned I do not think that so eminent a person as the hon’ble Minister would in any way object to the second portion of the Resolution and it is really a little shameful that while we have firms of adequate standard and quality Government business should be going out to foreign agency firms. This is not the sectionalism. It is certainly the duty of the Government to assist their own nationals particularly when they are of the requisite quality.",
114: "We agree in principle with the underlying idea of this Resolution that there should be ceiling put on the income to begin with of the civil servants. This class of civil servants has been created by the erstwhile rulers of India the British Imperialists. They have created this class as slave drivers jobbers and mistries of this great industrial concern that they were running the Government of India. After freedom more particularly today when we are thinking in terms of planning when we are thinking in terms of closing the gap between the high and the low income in this country when we are thinking in terms of raising the living standards of the common people we have got to think in terms of even slashing the highest salaries that have been awarded to this class of people to this class of civil servants by the earlier rulers of this country. As trade unionists we have very bitter feelings. My friend Prof. Kishen Chand has just now said that there should be ceiling even on industrial income even on payment of salaries to the managers and managing staff of private concerns and commercial and industrial concerns. I entirely agree with that proposition. As trade unionists when we present a case for wage increases we have been shouting in every place in every industry that every concern wants to give higher salaries to the managerial staff in order that they may get the incentive to curb the workers in order that they may work upon the workers as slave drivers as mistries etc. I entirely agree with Prof. Kishen Chand that even the salaries of such people must be slashed: even they must be asked to receive a lower income. Just as a private industrialist in the interests of the exploitation in the interests of curbing down ordinary labor want to pay higher salaries to the supervisory staff to the managerial staff similarly the Government of India the earlier Government of India the British Government was paying higher salary to this type of managerial staff of this slave concern. Today Sir we are thinking in terms of covering up this gap of shortening this gap and in such circumstances it is absolutely necessary that on the one hand we raise the incomes of the lower income groups and on the other slash down the incomes of the higher salaried people. I entirely agree with the proposition that the higher salaried people also may be given social amenities like housing health services and so on but these should be included in their total emoluments which must not be so high. When the posts and telegraphs employees when the railway employees when the Government of India employees ask for a new Pay Commission to be appointed as the earlier Commission was appointed at a period when the salary structure of the country was not certain when the Government itself was not in our hands but that now the production has increased that the economy of the country is going up in a particular direction the leadership of the country wants to take the country in a particular direction you do not agree. When the posts and telegraphs employees the railway employees the non-gazette employees ask for an increase in their salaries you come out saying that their salaries will not be increased unless they increase further the output and production. In this case you want to link up production with salary when we are telling you that there is no incentive to the railway employees to the posts and telegraphs employees to the non-gazetted employees. You do not say anything but you say that there should be incentive to the I.C.S. officers the Police Commissioners and to all these people in the shape of high salaries. This is your policy. But Sir this policy does not hold good with the declaration of a socialistic pattern. In the international organisations in the I.L.O. and in other places you say that there should be equal pay of equal work but certain categories get a very high salary while certain others who may not be counted as civil servants who may not be counted as the collectors but who put in exactly the same amount or even more of work are not paid the same amount. For example the Collector is paid a certain amount but what about the Civil Surgeon. Is not the Civil Surgeon equally responsible? Is he not the district medical authority? Even then look at the disparity between the salaries of the Civil Surgeon and the Collector. This sort of disproportion is there even in the higher services. There is disproportion not only between the higher services and the lower services but there is disproportion even between the higher services of different categories among the Forest Services Judicial Services Medical Services Engineering Services. In all these cases there is this type of disparity. The nature of work the amount of work total energy expended may be same or even more but the salary given is less. Therefore Sir there is absolute justification that the whole thing should be investigated the whole thing should be gone into and a new salary structure must come which will definitely bring down this gap. Mr. Deputy Chairman Sir I am really very happy that my friend Mr. Mukerjee has place this Resolution before the House. Just at present I am not considering the feasibility of implementing it. But it gives us an opportunity to examine the approach that is adopted by the Planning Commission as well as by the Government. My line of argument would be more or less similar to that of Professor Ranga. If one reads the Planning Commission’s Report it makes a very very disappointing reading. When coming to the income of the professional people as well as the commercial classes the objective before the Planning Commission is thirty times the minimum income.",
115: "Mr. Chairman I have the honour to present the report of the Planning Commission on the Second Five Year Plan. Slightly over three and half years ago I had the privilege to present the Report of the First Five Year Plan to this House. At that time the first plan had already been functioning for about a year and a half by the time that Report was ready and was presented to Parliament. Now we have come to this House soon after the Second Five Year Plan is supposed to have begun; that began on the 1st April. These dates are convenient to consider these matters but of course there is no break between the first and the second and the third. Planning is continuous; the implementation of a Plan is continuous just as the life and activities of the country are continuous. Nevertheless it is helpful to see in these periods of time as to how far we have gone and what we have achieved and to decide what to do in the future. Hon’ble Members will get this rather bulky volume containing the Report from the Notice Office today. They will also probably get summaries of it cyclostyled I think for the present but they will be printed very soon and circulated to Members. In addition to this the Planning Commission proposes to issue as soon as possible bigger summaries in printed book form not only in English but also in the various Indian languages sections of the book separately printed and also other material dealing with this. I understand that it has been decided that Joint Committees of this House and the Lok Sabha should consider this Report from to-day onwards and sometime today the Chairmen of those four Committees will meet the Members and the Minister for Planning to decide on their procedure and they will consider this for about a week. Those Committees will be divided up taking four group of subjects. Roughly speaking this Report can be divided up into two parts the second part dealing with the detailed programme and projects and the first part with the broader issues. Members will no doubt be interested in both parts more especially in so far as the detailed programme applies to their own areas but probably the first part containing the broad policies approach etc. will be more important from the point of view of this House because it is from that that the rest follows and I imagine that when the time comes as it will in about a week’s time or so for this House to debate on this Report more attention will be paid to the first part containing the principles etc. In regard to the details it would be more convenient for them to be considered whenever necessary not in a debate in this House but by Hon’ble Members meeting the Minister for Planning or other representatives of the Planning Commission and discussing them with them. It is by no means enough even now but when we started with the First Five Year Plan we were conditioned and limited in many ways. We had very little data very little statistics and such statistics as were supplied to us were often very unreliable being based usually on some patwari statement in a village about agricultural production. Also we were tied up at the time when the First Five Year Plan began with a number of major schemes which we could not and did not want to leave. Now those major schemes absorbed a great part of our resources and we had not too much left for our other plans. That was one reason why the actual Report the First Five Year Plan Report came up before this House a year and a half after the Plan was supposed to begin functioning. Well since then we have had this Five Year Plan and we have had reports about the measure of success it has achieved. I think it is justifiable for us to say that the First Five Year Plan by and large was a success. In some maters it was a great success; in some matters it was not such a great success but it fulfilled anticipations but taking it all in all the First Five Year Plan succeeded and succeeded in two easy. One was the fact of reaching the targets aimed at and going beyond them in regard to food in regard to cloth in regard to several other things but something that is much more important really that is in creating a hopeful atmosphere in the country that is to say our people became planning conscious. Our people realized that by this method of planning we were advancing. We were making good on the food front to some extent; in regard to certain industries also our production rose. I do not mean to say that in the context of the enormous and difficult problems that we are facing in India the First Five Year Plan succeeded in solving any of those vast problems. Now we started with this great advantage on this occasion which we did not have previously because to-day everybody in India at least very large numbers of people in India talk of planning think of planning discuss planning even in our villages; may be their idea of planning is somewhat limited but that does not matter; it is bound to be so and people realize that it is by this planned approach that we are likely to succeed in solving our great problems. That has been a great advantage to us. The second advantage has been as I said that we have some more statistics some more experience but with the greater experience and with the greater knowledge that we have now also has come an appreciation of the great difficulties that we have to face. The problems which were vague have become more concrete and in becoming more concrete we now realize how big they are.",
116: "Mr. Deputy Chairman the generous support which the hon’ble Members of this House have been good enough to accord to this measure is a source of courage and strength to me but it is equally a source of embarrassment because I do not consider this Bill to be the end of the process. It is the beginning of the process and the success of this Bill will not be judged by the provisions contained in it but by their implementation. I fell that today I am being put on trial and if I am deserving any appreciation or praise it will be on the day when I make a success of this Bill. Now from the debate that has been held in this House I have a feeling that there is not a very correct appreciation of the scope of this Bill. I made an attempt to explain the scope of the Bill in my opening speech but it must be due to my fault that I could not fully bring home to the hon’ble Members the scope of this Bill. This Bill presents only a part of an integrated picture which was drawn up by the Rural Credit Survey Committee. The financing or the credit part of it has been entrusted to the Reserve Bank. Some hon’ble Members have mentioned that there is no provision for the creation of the land mortgage banks. I submit that there should have been no provision for the creation of the land mortgage banks because that is the credit side which has been handled by the Reserve Bank. It does not need any legislation. There are already laws for the incorporation of the co-operative societies in the States and any land mortgage bank can either be incorporated under that law or under a specialized law. Some hon’ble Members have mentioned that there is no mention of regulated markets in it. Hon’ble Members would be aware that markets and fairs from part of Entry 28 on the State List. The Union Parliament is not competent to legislate about regulated markets and despite the recommendations of the Rural Credit Survey Committee we felt that we cannot legislate about them. They have therefore been left out. More than one hon’ble Members has said that there is no provision for education of officials and others who will be handling the co-operatives societies. Now we need no legislation for that and there is no necessity to make any provision in law. There is already a high class college in Poona which imparts education to the highest type of officials needed for co-operative societies. Then we have set up five regional colleges which will train intermediate personnel. Twenty one co-operatives schools have been set up for training subordinate personnel. Some other institutions have been set up for training non-officials and co-operative officers for Community Project areas. We did not feel that it was necessary to make any provision in this law. Nonetheless I am fully alive to the importance of having properly trained staff for running the co-operative societies. Hon’ble Members would be aware that a Committee has been set up for training the co-operative personnel. That Committee has been constituted by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and the Reserve Bank because these are the two institutions which would need those trained personnel. I also agree that one of the causes of the failure of the co-operative movement in the past has been the want of properly trained personnel. We are not going to repeat that mistake and let me assure the hon’ble Members that we propose to lay the highest emphasis on the training of the officials as also of the non-officials in the co-operative principles. I am fully conscious of the fact that the co-operative institutions which we propose to set up either under this Act or which are going to be set up by the Reserve Bank or by the State Government can be a success only when a proper climate has been created and for that purpose the co-operation of the non-officials who have been initiated into the principles of co-operation who have a faith and belief in those principles is indispensable and therefore our scheme of training also includes training of the non-officials in the principles of co-operation. This Bill has a definite but a limited object and that limited object is to set up co-operative marketing co-operative processing co-operative production and warehousing. The other parts of this picture will be provided by other institutions. Now the House is aware that the Imperial Bank of India has been converted into the State Bank of India the sole objective of which was that the marketing of the agricultural produce should be financed by that institution. In my opening speech I mentioned specifically that the State Bank of India will perform three functions. It will provide remittance facilities to the co-operative societies which is a very important function. It will advance loans against the commodities in godowns and warehouse. It will also accept the warehouse receipts and advance moneys against them. Financing will be done by the State Bank of India which has got sufficient resources which is an expanding institution and which is going to set up a large number of branches and which will do the financing. So far as the capital structure of the Central Warehousing Corporation is concerned we have purposely kept the limit of the subscribed capital at a comparatively low level. The authorized capital is Rs. 20 crores and the issued capital would be Rs. 10 crores. Hon’ble Members will kindly refer to clause 37 of the Bill which is the key clause so far as the financing part of it is concerned. The Central Warehousing Corporation will borrow money through bonds to the extent of ten times their subscribed capital.",
117: "Then Sir we must find out the main reason why there were so many writ petitions and petitions for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. That was so because in most of these cases we had made the decision of that tribunal final. Now under the Constitution the Supreme Court has got the right to grant special leave of appeal. That is naturally untouched. Similarly the High Courts have got the right of the power to issue writs. Of course I cannot say that it is all without justification. Probably many of those courts thought that in a matter where the aggrieved party had not remedy whatsoever they should rather have the right to look into that matter. And it was from that point of view probably that we had so many appeals and so many writs issued by the High Court. Now we are going to provide in this measure for a direct appeal to the High Court itself. As the lawyer Members probably know when there is a remedy by way of appeal no High Court ordinarily issues any writ and the Supreme Court is not expected to grant any special leave of appeal. It has therefore been found desirable to provide straightway for an appeal to the High Court by an aggrieved party. This will also I think remove much of the delay which is ordinarily caused by these matters. Apart from that Sir the clause itself mentions that the tribunal shall decide the election petition within six months and that the High Court shall dispose it of within three months. I know that even if we impose such a restriction it may not necessarily be so. But I am sure that unless there are any special reasons etc. the tribunals will dispose of these mattes within six months and the High Courts also will give priority to matters like these and dispose them of within three months. So the hon’ble members will find that the present provision that has been made in this Bill is much more satisfactory than the previous one. Then Sir as the hon’ble Members are aware there was a little confusion with regard to the various categories of corrupt practices. For instance there were major corrupt practices; there were minor corrupt practices; and there were illegal practices and all of them had different effects under different circumstances. And even some of the lawyers found this matter rather a very intricate one. In the present Bill therefore only corrupt practices have been mentioned and the distinction between major and minor corrupt practices has been taken away. Of course so far as offences are concerned there is that category of electoral offences and that has been done not with a view to changing any particular effect with respect to the matters which are undesirable but that has been done with a view to making the whole thing far more simple and easily understandable. So you will find that so far as the present Bill is concerned it has made the election law as simple as possible. Probably there has been some difference of opinion in the other House and there might be some difference of opinion in this house as well with regard to the clause relating to disqualification and particularly with regard to the disqualification incurred by a person who has been sentenced to imprisonment for two years and more. The reason for that is that generally the offences for which a man is sentenced to two years are cognizable offences and offences of a more serious nature. It was therefore thought that in such a case he should not be allowed to stand for five years more. But even then as matters now stand that disqualification can be removed by the Election Commission in suitable cases. Now as the hon’ble Members are aware the Election Commission is a special constitutional authority set up by us in order to ensure the free and fair elections which we want to have in the country. Therefore it is not as if this power is given to some executive officer of the Government. It is not correct to look at it from that point of view. As hon’ble Members know a man may be convicted or even sentenced to two years for offences which may not involve what is vaguely termed as ‘Moral Turpitude’. To introduce the words ‘moral turpitude’ in a measure like this will not be desirable because it is a term which may have a different meaning in different conditions and the different types of circumstances. This ‘moral turpitude’ is a thing which cannot be defined. Therefore the other House thought that the best way and the best remedy out of this was to leave the power to the Election Commission itself and I believe there has been no complaint till now in any proper case that the Election Commission has ever hesitated to remove disqualification if it could be done. I am sure that hereafter also there is no such danger so far as that independent authority is concerned. But to introduce the term ‘moral turpitude’ in this measure that very vague term has not been found. There are one or two other matters which were raised by previous speakers and which may be raised here also and I will briefly refer to them. Some thought that we might make voting compulsory. It is a very difficult thing to do in a democracy like ours which has just started functioning. We have adult franchise and 35 crores of people are involved. This is an impossible thing. You may compulsorily take a voter to the polling booth but I don’t know how you can compulsorily make him vote. Of course there are one or two countries like Australia and Belgium where I am told this thing is being done but with these exceptions all over the world no country has though it proper to do this on such a large scale.",
118: "Mr. Chairman when the House rose yesterday I was dealing with the criticism and strong condemnation made by my hon’ble friend Dr. Kunzru against the conduct of Ministers when they go out for election campaign on behalf of their party candidates. The language he used was of course strong and it is open to any Member to use such language as he considers proper. But I am constrained to say that on this occasion the quantum of his criticism and the language which he used was not only uncharitable but even ungraceful. He went to the length of not only suggesting but also specifically accusing the Ministers of being dishonest in as much as they tried to invent some Government business so that they might be able to travel at Government expenses and with high Government officers. The charge that he levelled against the Ministers was three-fold. Firstly they invent some business whereas the primary consideration with them is to carry on an election campaign. Secondly they go about in Government cars and their tour expenses are debited to the Government account. And thirdly they use the police officers and the magistrates to help them in connection with the elections. The third is of course by implication. Then Sir he has said something more than what I thought him to have said. I had said that it was only by implication. Now it was not only by implication but he says that he really meant it and he found the police officers and the magistrates helping the Ministers in organizing meetings. Well Sir so far as his personal knowledge in this respect is concerned I will not be so bold as to say that it is not correct for I have always held Dr. Kunzru in very high esteem ever since my college days. Therefore so far as his personal knowledge of anything is concerned I would not dispute it though I might say that my personal experience in this respect has always been otherwise. Possible on some one occasion it may have been a different matter when Dr. Kunzru saw it. Well the police officials are of course there. Sometimes some magistrate is also there particularly when our hon’ble Prime Minister goes about on an election campaign or for that matter wherever he goes. And that is necessary for security reasons. I hope that of all the persons Dr. Kunzru would not like that proper security measures should not be taken when our Prime Minister goes out. Sir yesterday I pointed out one unhappy incident of the very recent past when our Prime Minister went somewhere in Madhya Pradesh I suppose and when somebody sprang upon him in order to attack him. Therefore Sir it has been found necessary always to take all the necessary precautionary measures when the Prime Minister goes about or when the other important Ministers go about. Sir the second thing that he said was that they go about in Government cars. It is indeed an astounding proposition coming as it does from Dr. Kunzru. But I am sure even he would not say that he has seen any Minister going about in a Government car when on an election campaign. The Ministers surely all of them at the Centre at least have their own cars. Of course they are lent money by the Government but then they have to pay it back in instalments and the wear and tear thereof is all being borne by the Ministers themselves. So I fail to see where the question of a Government car comes in. Then Sir he has said that the expenses are all debited to the Government account. I wish before making such a statement he had made his position sure about it. Has he any basis for it? Surely this is not correct. I say that it is absolutely incorrect. Our Prime Minister whenever he goes out not only on an election campaign but on any Congress business the entire expenses of his tour and travel are borne by the Congress or by Prime Minister himself. In the year 1952 when he went round the country on the election campaign every single rupee of the expenditure was borne by the All India Congress Committee. This news may be a little discomforting to Dr. Kunzru but then here is the fact. Whenever he went on such a business the charges were borne by the All India Congress Committee. Whenever he went on plane the charges were borne by the All-India Congress Committee the halting charges for instance and all the travelling expenses not only of himself but also of any one of his colleagues if he happened to be with him. This is so not only in the case of the Prime Minister but even in the case of other Ministers. Whenever they go out on Congress business they are sent out by the Congress Committee and their entire expenses are borne either by the All-India Congress Committee or by the Ministers themselves. Only the other day Shri Jagjivan Ram went to Agra. It is a very recent instance only about a couple of months ago. He went there on election business and not a rupee of that travelling expense was debited to the Government account. All that expense was borne by the Congress. When Shri Jagjivan Ram went to Andhra Pradesh during the election campaign there all the expenses incurred by him were borne either by the Congress Party or by Shri Jagjivan Ram himself. Sir here are specific instances which I am giving. I would however like to know from Dr. Kunzru whether he can substantiate his charge by anything definite. Let it not be documentary but let him at least prove it by his personal knowledge. If he says that I will be prepared to admit that on some occasion it may have been so. But has he got personal knowledge with respect to even one single instance?",
119: "Sir I am very grateful to you for the opportunity you have given me to make a statement. This relates to the exodus of Hindus from East Pakistan a matter which has been causing great anxiety to the Government of India arising out of the discussions between the Pakistan Foreign Minister and our Minister for Rehabilitation during the visit to Karachi for the Pakistan Republic Day celebrations. The Pakistan Prime Minister suggested a meeting at ministerial level at Dacca to discuss this problem. The Government of India accepted the suggestion. The talks were held on the 5th and 6th May 1956. The Indian delegation led by the Minister for Law and Minority Affairs comprised among others the Minister for Rehabilitation the Deputy Minister for External Affairs the Indian High Commissioner in Pakistan and the Minister for Labour West Bengal Government. The Pakistan delegation which was led by their Foreign Minister included among others their Minister for Minority Affairs the Chief Minister of East Pakistan and their High Commissioner in India. There was drank exchange of views between the two delegations on the causes of migration and possible remedies for checking it. It was agreed that the minorities were the responsibility of the Government of the country to which they belonged and that they should look up to their own Government for the redress of their legitimate grievances. On their part the Government should ensure conditions in which the minorities are enabled to live in happiness and security as equal citizens with members of the majority community. The problem of the minority communities in East Pakistan was accordingly one to be solved by the East Pakistan Government but the Government of India would be happy to extend all possible co-operation to the Government of Pakistan in solving it. On behalf of the Government of Pakistan their representatives reiterated the determination to safeguard fully and effectively the right of the minorities to live honourably as full citizens of Pakistan as guaranteed by the Pakistan Constitution. It was stated that the Government of East Pakistan had already taken certain measures with a view to restoring confidence among the minorities. An advisory board consisting of M.L.As. of all non-Muslim political parties had been appointed with the Chief Minister as President. This Board would supervise the implementation of measures considered necessary to deal with factors encouraging migration. A Hindu officer of the civil services of Pakistan has been appointed as Special Officer for Minority Affairs. He has been given powers to take up grievances of the minorities with the East Pakistan authorities and all Government departments. Measures had been taken to speed up recruitment of members of the minority communities in Government Service. As a matter of general rule relaxation of age limit and educational qualifications has been ordered. The Special Officer for Minority Affairs has also been directed to examine all recruitment figures to ensure adequate representation of the minorities. The Revenue Department has been instructed to employ members of the minority communities to the extent of 23 per cent of the vacancies in the Estates Acquisition Department. The minority Commission is going to be revived and Minority Boards to be established down to the Thana level. Orders have been issue derequisitioning Hindu houses. The East Pakistan Chief Minister said that more such houses would be derequisitioned if their owners wanted to come back and live in them. The Pakistan delegation also said that in case of complaints regarding abduction of women officers have been directed to recover the girls immediately and send them to the neutral Home in Dacca. Strict instructions have been issued to all officers of the Government that there should be no discrimination against members of the minority communities. The Pakistan delegation was of the view that these steps should ensure security and restore confidence among the minority communities and that there should be no further cause for migration provided the Government of India co-operated. It was suggested that the Government of India should stop issuing migration certificates – in other words seal the border. The Indian Delegation was of the view that this could not be done since the Prime Ministers’ Agreement of 1950 assured freedom of movement and protection in transit to migrants. The Pakistan delegation also expressed the opinion that one of the causes encouraging migration was the comparative ease with which a migration certificate could be obtained. There was also the attraction of the rehabilitation benefits promised by India to migrants. It was pointed out by the Indian delegation that the rehabilitation benefits given by the Government of India were quite meagre and certainly not sufficient to tempt a person to give up his hearth and home. The Indian delegation also explained that migration certificates were issued after proper examination. In view of the various steps that the Pakistan Government had already taken or intended to take to solve the problem the Indian delegation also agreed that the machinery for receiving and examining applications for migration certificates will be strengthened so as to prevent abuse or exploitation of migration facilities by anti-social elements. After the Conference two representatives from each delegation were deputed to draft a joint communique. Apparently through some misunderstanding the first draft which had not been approved by the Indian delegation was released to sections of the local press and this created some confusion. Later the draft was discussed by the two delegations and a mutually agreed communique was released late at night on the 6th of May 1956. A copy of the agreed communique is placed on the Table of the House. The two-day Indo-Pakistan conference to consider the question of minority exodus from East Pakistan came to an end today in an atmosphere of cordiality after a full and frank exchange of views. It was also agreed that the minorities are the responsibility of the Government of the country to which they belong.",
120: "Sir in so far as the Plan is concerned its main principles and objectives are I believe acceptable almost unanimously to all the sections of this House. The main objective is that we must bring in a socialist society and not merely say what a socialist society is. And the Plan has defined what its main objective or its main purpose in having a socialist society is. The main purpose is that whatever development we are going to do in this country the object should be the socio-economic gain of the community as a whole in place of private profit. And secondly Sir the whole pattern of development and the structure of the socio-economic relations should be so planned that they result not only in increasing the national income and the employment opportunities but there should also be greater and greater equality in incomes. Sir the other day a private Member’s Resolution was being discussed in this House with regard to the fixation of a ceiling on incomes and the hon’ble Prime Minister happened to be present at that time. He very clearly defined what the object of such a move would be. The whole idea is that we must level up the society that is to say we must raise the income at the lowest level so that the disparities disappear. Of course we must also bring about a reduction in those big incomes which are at the top but that alone will not solve the problem at all. It has not solved the problem in any country at all. The most conspicuous example in this respect is the United States of America. I believe in the recorded history of mankind there is no country which has succeeded so amply in practically abolishing the exploited labour class. Today there is no such exploited Labour class in the country. The whole population from the very bottom has been elevated to a sort of middle class. I was told that even the cook in an Indian embassy comes in his car to do the work and then goes back in his own car. Here even Members of Parliament cannot come in their own cars. There even a sweeper comes in a car. That is the object which we should have. In merely getting rid of the few people at the top we are not going to solve that problem. If we distribute what they have it would not last for more than a day or two. In any case it can satisfy our little anger or if I may say so our malice but that cannot solve the economic problem of the nation as a whole. Therefore Sir the main purpose is that we must raise the level of income at the lowest level of the community. That is the aim of this Plan. We must raise the living standards of our people and we must enlarge the opportunities of employment. We know Sir that both in the countryside in the rural areas as well as in the urban areas there is not only unemployment but there is also under-employment on a very large scale which is one of the main causes of our poverty. And if the Plan succeeds in enlarging these opportunities of employment it will have attained a very great object. Then Sir another object and the principle is to promote enterprise among the different classes. Now Sir the whole nation is not just on one level as it is in the case of France Germany or England. We are if I may say so a sort of multi-national people. All sorts of communities are there. We have got the backward areas we have got the Scheduled Tribes we have got the Scheduled Castes. And certain communities have got an advantage over other communities maybe for any reason or maybe due to the British period. There is for instance the Parsi community or the Marwari community whereas there are large sections of the people who have got no hand in the industries at all who merely live on agriculture and are therefore on a very poor level. Therefore our aim is to plan investments in such a way as would lead to the promotion of industrial enterprises among the disadvantaged classes so that every section of the community every caste in the community may have an equal opportunity for all the good things of life because merely calculating that our per capita income will be so much or our national income will be so much will not solve our problems. What we want is that all the communities which have been at a disadvantage so far for whatever may have been the historical reasons should have equal opportunity to advance and better their conditions of life. Then all the jealousies between region and region between class and class and between caste and caste will go and then we shall begin to feel that this commonwealth is a co-operative commonwealth in which all have a share an equal share in these opportunities. Then the object is that we must industrialise the country as quickly as possible with a great emphasis on heavy industries. To that end the Government of India has pronounced a new industrial policy revising the policy that had been laid down in 1948 and this new policy lays down that the public sector has to be enlarged so as to include all industries of basic and strategic importance or in the nature of public utility services. This is all very nice. They have given schedules more or less on the lines of the schedules attached to the Indian Constitution. The Prime Minister was at great pains yesterday to explain with which all reasonably-minded people will agree that the private sector should be allowed and encouraged to play its full part so that productive machinery or production apparatus does not suffer any diminution in the volume or quantum of production.",
121: "A few days ago I had the honour of presenting the Report of the Planning Commission on the Second Five Year Plan to this House. On that occasion I said something about the preparation of this Report during the last two years and more. The Report is a fairly formidable volume to look at but perhaps if all the papers that were prepared in connection with this Report during the last two years were piled together they would be something in the nature of a hundred times this volume. That of course does not mean that the quality of the work must necessarily be high but I mention this fact merely to indicate to the House how much labour had gone how much discussion had taken place before this Report reached its more or less final stage. In a subject like planning I do not know what hon’ble Members of this House think but to me who is no expert but who has been connected with thinking and discussion about planning for the last many years I found my own mind expanding and always fresh avenues coming into view and there is no end to the process and when I present this Report to this House I would call it in no sense a final Report but a Report of the work done thus far. The work continues like the whole question of planning continues like indeed the vast and varied activity of the nation continues. The book deals in the ultimate analysis not with some theory but also with the activities of hundreds of millions of people in this country and that is a tremendous theme to think about and it is a difficult thing and it has so many uncertainties about it because fortunately human beings are not made after the same model. Each human being is an individual who thinks who acts somewhat differently from others. We have not like an engineer to measure the amount of steel or the amount of cement or something else that goes towards the making of a bridge or some other building. One can weigh and say exactly what the tensions and the strength are. Human beings being different we cannot lay down any hard and fast rule about it that a hundred or a thousand human beings will produce this or that result and therefore this uncertain and fascinating factor comes in which makes human beings more important than other things in this world. But that makes planning also difficult with a large number of uncertainties about it. That would be so at any stage but more so at this stage in our country and in the world when everyone who looks around is conscious of revolutionary happenings changes continuously taking place almost in any respect but if I may say so most of all in regard to technology the changes in technology and technology ultimately effects human occupations human life the social structure. Now it is obvious that the pace of change in technology has been tremendous and stupendous. That pace has not affected us very much in India thus far it is affecting us more and more. Even so our lives in this country are governed so much by the consequences of science and technological growth. Most things that we do are somehow concerned with them. Now they are concerned with them. Therefore they will be concerned even more by the changes in technological growth. Everybody knows how these changes in technological growth are advancing and affecting if I may say so the science of war. We have to deal with atomic energy the atom bomb the hydrogen bomb etc. one does not realise that even in peaceful avocations the changes are progressively almost as big. They do not create such a bang as that atom bomb does but in effect the coming of atomic energy is likely to produce enormous changes that is it will bring in all kinds of new supplies of power which will make a great difference to any problem that we may face but apart from atomic energy the other changes in technology are very great and they are continuous in affecting anything that we need. If we have a machine made any big machine by the time it is ready it is slightly out of date; something has taken place which is a little more advanced a little more effective. Because of this anything that we may plan is likely to be obviously affected by these changes and other matters long before the period of the Plan is over. That is one major uncertainty. Then of course there are the uncertainties about our own resources about the capacity of the human beings in this country as to whether we can devote our energies to this great and mighty task or fritter them away in arguing or in disputing or in quarrelling about smaller things in this country. There is presumably a certain maximum quantum of national energy available. It may grow. Now how much of that can we devote to this task of implementing a Plan? How much of it will be spend in other ways which are not fruitful? How much of it in destructive ways and disruptive ways? All these are uncertainties and we have seen even in the past few months enough of national energy being if I may say so with all respect not only wasted but doing a great deal of harm to the sense of national unity national purpose of working together. I am not going into the question of the merits of any matter but it is obvious that we have to undertake a very great task because we start from somewhere near the bottom level of economic advance. Ours is a country which in terms of per capita income is very low down in the scale of other countries. We have evidence of technical achievements and there are many great schemes at work.",
122: "The Planning Commission has made various estimates about our resources and they are based on a great deal of thinking and calculation. Nevertheless they depend on so many uncertain factors. A person who is more optimistically inclined may make a better estimate better in the sense of more hopeful estimate while a pessimist may make a less hopeful estimate; nobody can challenge it. For my part I have an invincible feeling that in the final analysis the resources of India are considerable in our people’s capacity ability and energy and the question arises how to reach them and how to tap them to the best advantage. I think this can be done by the realization by the people themselves that it is worth while doing so by their full co-operation and the like. It can never be done by Government decree or by an order from above. Therefore it becomes important that our people should realise and understand fully what this process of planning is. Therefore we tried to a considerable extent to get the co-operation of as many people as possible even at the district level apart from a large number of groups of various kinds. I think it may be well said that India is very conscious of planning today. I was reading a foreigner’s book the other day in which he says that in India you cannot get away from this planning business. He had written it in slight irritation. Whatever you talk about somehow they lead you to the question of planning as though everything depended on planning everywhere. Well whether his irritation was justified or not I was glad to read that a person with no great sympathy for what we were doing felt enveloped by some kind of an atmosphere of planning. Everybody can talk of planning. Of course everybody who talks of planning may know very little about planning. That is not the point but it is true that India is very much planning-conscious and I think it is a great gain. When I say planning-conscious I mean of course planning-conscious in the democratic structure that we possess. That is we are proceeding with democratic planning. I am not criticizing any country that may not plan or any country that plans in some other way authoritarian or some other way. It is none of my business to criticize other countries. They have to meet their problems and it is up to them to decide how to meet them. They can judge their own people. But so far as we are concerned in this country people believe that we should endeavor to plan by the democratic method. Planning in a small way has often been done and is often done elsewhere. Planning in a really big way has thus far only been done more or less by the authoritarian approach and the question arises how far a non-authoritarian and democratic approach can succeed in this kind of planning. I believe it can; and not only that I believe it can ultimately succeed better nor perhaps in yielding such great results quickly but in laying a surer foundation and more effective foundation not only for planned growth but for the type of society which we wish to develop in this country. Now we talk about the future in terms of socialist pattern of society and that can be interpreted in a variety of ways. I would beg this House to try to consider these great problems without using as far as possible words which have an emotional connotation because then it becomes a little difficult for us to argue about the real thing. We want a society in this country where there is equality where there is social cohesion where there are no firm classes separated from each other and where there is opportunity for every single individual. Naturally how far an individual takes advantage of that opportunity depends a great deal on that individual on his physical or mental or spiritual or whatever it is make-up because everybody is not alike. It is obvious that everybody is not either mentally or physically alike but we should always ensure the same measure of opportunity to everyone. Now it is not enough to say that we shall ensure the same measure of opportunity if the measure of opportunity is so low that there is practically no opportunity. It then does little good to say that everybody is getting the same measure of opportunity. It is not much good saying that everybody has the same measure of opportunity on poverty level because that means lack of opportunity to everybody. Therefore in order to give that opportunity we have to have something to give. That is to say we have to get out of poverty and lack of opportunity; we have to produce wealth because only out of that can we produce the things that are necessary for people to have that opportunity we crave for. So it comes round to our producing the things that we require. When we use the word ‘wealth’ of course there is no significance except in regard to the physical things that we require whatever we may require whether it is food or clothing or housing of hundreds and thousands of other things that are necessary. Education health and all that are the things that we require and that we want to place before everyone. How do we do that? There was considerable argument about a year ago about what was called physical planning and financial planning as if there was an inherent contradiction between the two. Many people thought that the use of this term ‘physical planning’ was dangerous and was meant to turn our approach in a wrong and harmful direction. Now I do not understand how there can be any planning of any kind without physical planning. Obviously whatever you may plan you have to plan for the goods you have to plan for food.",
123: "Now from the point of view of labour also this measure is very important. I am giving all the arguments. The Second Five Year Plan admits that in order to keep up production in the country in order to develop our industries it is of great importance to enthuse the working class and the workers. It is the correct approach. As far as words go nobody will quarrel with it. In fact we would like more and more workers to be enthused. Such measures should be brought in more and more in order to make the working class see that with the increase in productivity on their part at least there is improvement in their living conditions that with the increased production of consumer goods in the country they get more resources in their hands to buy the things that they require to spend more money on their children on their housing on their health on the education of their children and all that. You have to create a situation like this; you have to create a feeling like this; you have to make provision for this. Even from that angle it is necessary that this should be accepted. Labour enthusiasm cannot be created until and unless you relate the increase in productivity to an increase in the living standards of our people. More production more money in the pockets of the working class. More money in the pockets of the working class more consumption of their daily necessities of life and less privations and difficulties. Am I wrong in this? I would ask the hon’ble Member to say. Therefore on that score it is essential. Then even from the point of view of industrial expansion it is essential. You will ask me how. I will tell you how. Now it means that if this provident fund contribution is not taken from them to that extent the money will be the working class. And this money they would be able to spend in the market as customers and buyers of commodities. What does it mean? What are the economic implications of such a thing? Such a thing means that the demands for consumer goods in the country will go up. There will be expansion in the internal market. It is very essential when we talk about the industrial expansion that we also ensure expansion in the market. Unless there is a growing demand in the country for the industrial goods you cannot have the expansion of industries. Expansion of industries does not take place in a satisfactory way disregarding this factor of expanding consumption in the country. In order to ensure expanding consumption on the part of the working people it is necessary for you to make more money available to them for consumption. Now I will be up against the question what about the savings of the community? You will ask should not the workers contribute something towards the common savings for our country? I say do not start with the workers savings those who are not in a position to save. You cannot expect those people who are not getting two square meals a day whose children go without education and other elementary necessities of life to go on saving in an uncertain provident fund by undergoing all manner of denials at present. You cannot expect such a thing. Therefore it is not a question of saving on the part of the workers. That money which you give him is invested in other sectors of economy by way of increased consumption which stimulates you industrial production. But we are saying do not keep the gap. If that gap has to be filled get the money from the capitalist class the class which is in a position to save. By adopting such a policy there will be a lot of savings. Savings takes place not at the cost of the worker not at the cost of contradiction of the whole market not by stifling the stimulants that are required for the industrial expansion in the economy as a whole. Savings takes place on the basis of those who are in a position to save. All that money which would have been otherwise spent left in the hands of the capitalist class for unproductive purposes in importing race horses and perfumes and all manner of things would be available for being spent on clothes books medicines and other things which are essential for the vitality of the community and for its healthy growth. Therefore from any angle that you judge this measure is a very good measure and I think the hon’ble Deputy Minister would not mind accepting it. He is somewhat allergic to me and to the communist benches generally. I am very sorry for it if we caused this king of allergy to anybody. But he need not be allergic to us in this matter at all. We have followed some of the States objectives in the Second Five Year Plan pronounced objectives in the Second Five Year Plan in formulating and presenting this Bill to this House. We would not have done it had we thought that this is such a fundamental thing that he would never accept it that this is something which is not at all within your domain. We think the hon’ble Members of the Congress Party can accept it. We read their speeches we also read the deliberations of their various party meetings and sessions. We read some of their publications and we are of course surprised at the declarations that they make from time to time. We take note of them. We take a serious view; we attach great importance to them. Therefore we feel that the Congress Members opposite can easily bring themselves up to accept this measure. This is in line with their thoughts. Whether these thoughts are being translated in the Government’s official policies or not is a different matter. But this is something which is untouchable for them.",
124: "Sir this amendment relating to clause 8 is most important and it affords us yet another opportunity to explain to the Government and to all those friends who do not still see eye to eye with us that clause 8 is perhaps the blackest clause in the Bill. We have made it very clear Mr. Deputy Chairman that we have very many clauses in this Bill to support. That is a matter of great satisfaction to us. Now Sir whatever the Government may be saying whatever the Prime Minister may be theorizing whatever new discoveries may be made by him with regard to the proposition of linguistic States and whatever accusations may be made against the other parties of breaking the unity of India the fact remains that the States Reorganisation Bill as we have it before us recognised in practice the reorganization of India largely on the basis of language. Nothing can detract this outstanding fact with regard to this Bill. Therefore Sir let us be very clear about it. It is not something that we are saying for the first time and it is not something which is very extraordinary. The whole Bill is based on the acceptance of the underlying principle of linguistic reorganization of States. A number of States on the basis are going to come into existence. But when we come to that region of Maharashtra and Gujarat we find a different type of dispensation meted out to them. There is no logic in it there is no reason in it and there is no principle in it except that the ruling party because of certain reasons suddenly decided upon taking this preposterous course. Mr. Deputy Chairman clause 8 creates a bilingual State of Bombay. But I can tell you straightway that the Bill was circulated to the various State Legislatures it did not contain the provision of the kind that we have before us. Thus the people in the State and their Legislators in particular were denied the opportunity of addressing their mind to this particular clause which we have before us. They discarded certain other things too. It was open to them to discard this matter also. They could not foresee that the Government would suddenly so change its mind that it would be necessary to discuss it. They concentrated on the provisions of the Bill based on the recommendations of the Commission. They had before them two important documents one the Commission’s recommendations with regard to Bombay and the other the proposals contained in the Bill that went to them. They concentrated only on those things and they could never have seen that certain hon’ble gentlemen would collect together in the lobbies signatures of various Members on a little piece of paper and flaunt them before the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister who has not been easily changeable in regard to this matter would suddenly change and accept the suggestion for the creation of a bilingual State. That is how this clause came into existence. And today Sir in this House we are called upon to support this clause regardless of what the Maharashtrians think about it and regardless of what the Gujaratis think about it. Mr. Deputy Chairman it pains us when we hear the Hon’ble Minister talking in one breath with regard to Himachal Pradesh and other States about the people’s will and yet when it comes to the question of Gujarat that right is denied to it. We find today before our eyes the mightly upsurge of the people of Gujarat demanding a linguistic State and it is perfectly known to the Government as to anybody else in the country that the people of Gujarat to a man are opposed to this provision of the Bill. And also Sir the people of Maharashtra are opposed to this Bill. Are these not facts? Can you explain why you are ignoring them? I found grave silence on the part of the Home Minister when he spoke in reply to the debate. He had nothing to say about the situation obtaining in Gujarat except to express his feelings for Shri Morarjibhai Desai. All of us have got feelings for him But greater are the people of Gujarat. I should have thought it that the tumultuous development which is shocking Gujarat to its very depth would have stirred the conscience of the hon’ble Ministers. They should have told us as to what is this thing that is happening there. They should have told the House why they are ignoring the feelings that are coming from Gujarat that this particular provision has got to be amended. They did nothing of the kind. They remained silent. Mr. Deputy Chairman in the course of the debate you know that I tried to find out as to how the Government’s mind was reacting to the developments in Gujarat. Hon’ble Members of the Treasury Benches thought that silence was golden in this case. How? Is this the way for a responsible Government to function? Is this the way to establish the authority of democracy? Is this the way to present to the Parliament to the people this question? I should have thought that hon’ble Ministers would give the best of thoughts to the developments in Gujarat even at this late hour and see whether that situation could be met. We wished certain changes in the Bill which would be acceptable to the people of Gujarat. A dogmatism has taken possession of them. Once they have decided that a bilingual State should come they decided that it shall remain. I tell you that you are swimming against currents. You are fighting against the forces of history. Mr. Deputy Chairman we were surprised to hear the hon’ble Home Minister talking about the unanimous verdict of the Lok Sabha. It is true that when the Bill was put to vote finally there was not a single dissenting voice. How could there be because there are many provisions in the Bill.",
125: "Mr. Vice-Chairman we are discussing the Railway Budget today. This Railway Budget will open a new chapter in the history of this House a chapter which is of a very discouraging nature. The Budget has been presented for the first time in this House by minority Government. So the people of the country do not find any improvement or any future with this Budget because in every budget there is political will behind the Budget. But in this Budget we do not see any political will for the development of railways in the country. The Indian Railways are the biggest public enterprise in the country. It is the largest in Asia and the second largest in the whole world managed by a single management. It plays a very vital role in the field of economic development of the country. Every sector of the society be it rich or poor every man or woman is affected by the performance of the Railway Department. Madam this Budget generally covers half of the economy of the country and affects the people in their multifarious problems. In this Budget the Railway Minister claims that he has given relief to the weaker sections which is not true. The exemption in the railway freight for the essential commodities is of peripheral nature. This kind of exemption is a poor consolation because these articles are already bearing fairly heavy freight charges. I had considered the Railway Minister to be a very dynamic person earlier. Now that impression has been taken away from my mind by his presenting this kind of a Budget in this House. He has committed a great mistake by increasing the passenger fares and railway freight rates at a time when the rate of inflation is already high. The restricted increase is also bound to affect the weaker sections of society. Another glaring factor is increase in regional imbalances. For example the south-eastern region has been badly neglected in many respects so far as railway development is concerned. I do not want to encourage the feeling of regionalism but in this budget this matter is so glaring that I cannot ignore mentioning it on the floor of the House. While new railway lines are being opened every year in the Northern States even sanctioned projects and sanctioned lines in Orissa are being stopped or delayed for years together. Madam as you know the Paradip Port was started 20 years back. In order to connect Paradip Port with the hinterland of ore mining areas a railway line was started some 16 years back. But that line has not been yet been completed on the plea that this portion of the line is not viable. This line is meant for carrying iron ore from the mining areas to the Paradip Port for export purposes. So far as the Railway map of India is concerned you kindly have a glance over the map of Orissa. You can easily imagine how Orissa was neglected. Before Independence Orissa had got two lines fortunately or unfortunately. One is the coastal line. The Britishers wanted to connect Calcutta and Madras. So they had the coastal railway line. In the western sector the Britishers wanted to connect Bombay and Calcutta. So fortunately some portion of the Bombay-Calcutta line went through Orissa in the western sector. But apart from these two lines nothing has been done. Madam the South- Eastern Railway Headquarters is situated in Howrah. Howrah is a place which does not belong to the South-Eastern Railway. The people of Orissa have been claiming and demanding since long to shift this Headquarters from Howrah to Orissa because the major portion of the South-Eastern Railway is in Orissa. But up till now the Government has not taken any steps to shift this Headquarters to Orissa. Last year in the Orissa Assembly there was a unanimous resolution in the House to shift this Headquarters from Calcutta to Bhubaneshwar or Cuttuck. But nobody has given any importance to this demand. In the last elections we faced a lot of trouble. Of course the Government in Orissa now has promised to the people that it will fulfil this demand a long-standing demand which Orissa has been demanding for 40 years to shift this Headquarters from Calcutta to Bhubaneshwar. It is to be seen how the Government of Orissa and the Government of India help in the shifting of the headquarters in Orissa. If you look to the present transport system of the Railways from Delhi to Bhubaneshwar the State capital there are two super-fast trains. One is the Neelachal Express and the other is Puri Express. They have been named super–fast but while the Puri Express takes 32 hours at the minimum from Delhi to Bhubaneshwar the Neelachal Express takes 36 hours. While these trains have been named as super–fast trains actually they are super-slow trains. There is another train coming from Puri. It is named as Utkal Express. We call it Bharat Darshan train. This train starts from Puri in the morning and it again enters Orissa the next day. It starts from Puri goes to Khargpur and then to Tatanagar and next day at about 2 O’clock again enters Orissa. It touches West Bengal Bihar Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan Uttar Pradesh Haryana and then come to Delhi. So this is perhaps the national integration train. It takes 52 hours to reach Delhi. Now I would make one submission to the hon’ble Railway Minister regarding the retiring Members of the House. Since long they are demanding railway pass for their journey. Uptill now the Government has not considered it. I would request the Railway Minister if he considers this case he will be remembered because it is their long standing demand on behalf of the Ex-MPs Association. So I request him to consider this demand favourably and grant them railway passes like retired Railway employees.",
126: "Sir I agree wholeheartedly with the sentiments expressed in favour of public co-operation in favour of the importance of public co-operation. I would like to place this question of public co-operation much higher than they have done in relation to the success of our Five Year Plans. It is indispensable for the success of the Five Year Plans. Not only for the Five Year Plans but also for the progress of the country in every direction public co-operation is of supreme importance. When we think of a plan usually it occurs to us that the requisites for the successful implementation of it are materials machines financial resources and personnel. Of course personnel is very important trained personnel of all categories but I personally feel that there are those other things less tangible which are even of greater importance. When these have been secured adequately those other things will follow. They are a sense of unity in the country a sense of discipline in the country and enlightened and enthusiastic co-operation of the people in all the various development programmes and the various schemes for the building up of the country. Therefore I think that a discussion of the question in this House has been of very great assistance. We think of the people merely as if they are beneficiaries of the plans. They are much more than that. They are of course the collaborators and makers of the plans and it is only when we succeed in securing that realization on the part of the people and that effective contribution from the people on that basis that things really will start moving very much more quickly than they do now. Our whole concept of public co-operation is very limited. We think of only people attending our meetings and of a little sharmdan here and there. The idea of public cooperation is very much deeper than that; it is much more fundamental. There are millions of people in the country who are in the fields factories and offices. The moment they begin to see that it is on a little better work harder work on their part that the progress of this country depends that realization itself will make for greater quicker and accelerated progress. As was pointed out by one hon’ble Member it is a question of attitudes it is a question of a certain perception a certain understanding. There has to be an understanding of what is going on in the country what the prospects are before us how they are related to our welfare as individuals and as families and also to the welfare of posterity. There is also something more than this intellectual appreciation; it is an emotional link with all this is happening. Public co-operation therefore has to be understood in that sense. It is the atmosphere which is created in the country in which all these schemes and all these development programmes are going to function; that is important for their success. That atmosphere depends upon the people their minds and their attitudes. There is also the question of resources. People help not only by their work. The resources also are drawn from them. They pay in various ways taxes loans etc. If we want to step up our development investment has to be increased. The resources for the public sector and the private sector come from the savings of the community. This means economy and avoidance of wasteful expenditure. One hon’ble Member said that austerity should not be restricted to the workers only. I never said that austerity should be practiced by the poor workers. I have always fought for higher wages for them. Certainly if we see that there is a small number of people who are rich well that small number also has to be called upon to avoid ostentatious expenditure and avoid wasteful consumption and wasteful expenditure. When we are thinking of a more equitable distribution and putting more money in the hands of a larger number of people it is not only the savings of a few that are going to push up the resources needed for the plan. Let it be very clear. It will have to be the savings of larger numbers of the community that will make the plan a success. Of course it is always understood that those who are at the lowest rung of the ladder certainly have nothing to spare but at various levels beneath that of the people who may have crores and many lakhs there are various groups whose savings are required and if we are to go away with the impression that it is only the income-tax payer and the rich whose savings and whose austerity are going to be sufficient then it is not going to be so. The question of harder work more honest work economy austerity in various degrees these are important for the plan. There is the question of the sense of discipline of how we behave towards each other and how we provoke each other. The occasion may be very small but it may appear at the time to be something of a crisis but when it is considered in relation to the vast question development of the country the future of the country that small trouble which arises out of one thing or the other pales into insignificance even from the point of view of the larger interest of those very groups. If they create disturbances if they create a commotion if they create a sense of insecurity that is bound to hamper the progress of the plan and they will suffer among others perhaps much more than by anything that they may gain by the things which provoke them into those things. It is just incidentally that I have mentioned this. There the people have to co-operate but there is the other aspect. Of course they have to bear the brunt of it. The initiative for public co-operation has to be theirs.",
127: "Mr. Deputy Chairman after hearing this discussion which has been threadbare there is very little new to be said on the subject and I will just say a few words by way of expression of the public views on this important measure. As we have seen since morning there is no section of the House which has welcomed this measure. This is apprehended to be unnecessary because we have seen there are two main things as far as this amending Bill is concerned. One is in regard to the summary eviction of the occupants and the other is unauthorized occupation. I would like to say that it may be that administratively the Government is faced with some difficulty but as it has been stressed in this House this question is more of a human nature than of any other administrative difficulty. Who are the people who are affected by this measure? In the first instances they are very poor people who are living in slums and in those undesirable conditions or they are refugees from Pakistan. We have seen that even rich people who came to India as refugees have had to take shelter in any corner or in the verandahs or on the pavements wherever they could find a little accommodation and they lived for years under conditions which were most unhealthy and undesirable. In due course of time these people have been able to put some roof over their heads. As it is it seems that the provisions which are sought to be provided in this amending Bill are very innocuous. But in view of the fact that it will affect mainly the poor people and refugees naturally it becomes a human problem and the legislators have to be very careful before they give their assent because they have to deal with the public directly. And therefore whatever comes before the House they have to see from the public point of view. I would submit that ordinarily there would be no difficult in giving assent to this Bill. Firstly even when they occupied the premises they had to face real harassment at the hands of the municipalities and also the improvement trust and others. Now that they have got some shelter over their heads if they are to be removed from there they have to be treated very kindly. I dare say just now the hon’ble Health Minister in a very sympathetic way explained the real position and I am sure the conditions would be as she has promised them to be. But even then we will have to take the extreme cases and see that these unfortunate people who were at one time middle class people or even rich people and are today refugees do not have to run from pillar to post for even a little space and a little shelter over their heads. If due to some mistake of the authorities or red-tapism or due to ordinary administrative difficulties the lower authorities take a strong view of it then their condition would become really harassing and very inconvenient. I would therefore submit that this summary eviction is a great sting in dealing with such kind of people who are very poor and especially who are refugees. As far as the land is concerned or the premises are concerned Government already possess the authority and power. Now they want to extend this authority even to the houses and therefore this summary evition is rather an objectionable thing. I do not know what difficulty the Government feels in not going to the law court whenever any person becomes unreasonable and he has to be removed and he does not want to go. More than one hon’ble Member has on the floor of the House stressed this point and I will submit that the sting will be taken out of this whole Bill if the summary evition provision is removed. In case of necessity the Government like any other private individual can go to the low court. Secondly in regard to unauthorized occupation also this provision has been made in clause 4(c). This new clause becomes a little difficult to be understood in the sense that a man is unauthorized although a previous authority had authorized him to occupy that premises or that house. Now the Government seeks to get the power to even declare that man who at one time had been authorized to be now unauthorized. This is also a very inconvenient provision as far as the poor people are concerned. Well I know that once Government bring a measure before this House Government rarely want to retrace their steps. The Government is determined to have this Bill passed. If the House had been left free probably it would reject it and this amending Bill will never be passed but by the employment of whip they would be able to pass it. I would in that case submit to the hon’ble Minister that when such occasions arise when a person has to be evicted alternative accommodation should be provided to such an unfortunate person near is place of occupation and near the place where he has got work. Of course the hon’ble Health Minister as a lady and also as a humanitarian and because of the portfolio she holds is very kind-hearted and she has given us a very special assurance that these people will be given every facility and it will be treated as a human problem even after passing the Bill. She has also told us how under the new conditions people have appreciated the position. But even then why are these people living in the slums? They are living there because they have no other means. The hon’ble Health Minister just now told us that they have been given accommodation in a better place where ordinarily they would have to pay Rs. 12. Now they are charged only Rs. 6 or half the rate for such poor people.",
128: "Sir I welcome this Bill because it is the first attempt to create and provide further technical personnel so necessary in the country. It is very well laid down that this Institute is the first in the chain of four high-grade technical institutions proposed to be started in the country to improve the tone of the engineering and technological education as well as to meet the present special needs of the industry which could not be achieved in the normal way. On these two special clauses I would like to offer some remarks. Because first of all we see that the tone of technical and engineering education is not at present what is desired or is necessary in the country. We should try to improve it and I can assure you that we cannot improve it in 5 or 10 years and this is the first attempt and if all efforts are made to improve the tone it will be in the larges interests of the country. The special needs of the country are increasing and the branches of engineering and technological education are multiplying every year in our country also. So the degrees and the courses will have to be multiplied. These are the two important points. Why our students are going in hundreds to foreign countries to acquire degrees in foreign Universities Because the training imparted is not adequate for the purpose for which it is meant namely to render service in the industry in which they wish to join later on. I wish to say here that this institution should be sufficiently financed and for want of finance it should not suffer in getting the best professors for training. Then the atmosphere that is to be created for imparting training is very important. Because technological engineering education is quite different from academical and theoretical education which is at present given in Universities. For that especially I welcome this association of under-graduate studies because if under-graduate study is there then it creates an atmosphere for those students to follow it and pursue it to post-graduate studies and in fundamental research. That is very important. I still say that if it is followed in all the four high-grade institutions then it will be useful. We should not fight shy of it because we are woefully lacking in technical skill and that skill has to be created. That can’t be created unless we have an atmosphere where students mix with each other in a fraternal way and discuss among themselves freely. It is not only by lectures by professors that they learn. It is also by the students getting together that they learn these things. As regards the suggestion for affiliating the Institute with the Calcutta University I don’t endorse that suggestion. This is a different institution from the present Universities and colleges and the training that to be given in them is also different. I think mere theoretical training is now given and we are lacking in technical training and we should improve our tone considerably in that respect and we should make this a model in our country. There may be co-ordination of this Institute with the four others that we want to establish but there should be affiliation with no other University. My third point is that the Education Ministry must make a census of how many students are going for technological and engineering degrees in foreign universities and why those students after their fundamental research after acquiring their Ph.D. degrees from those Universities after acquiring distinction in their training are not returning to this country to serve our industries where we so much require them. If the Education Ministry goes into this fact they will find that there are about 300 students both in America and in Europe working in the factories after getting their Ph. D degrees after acquiring the highest qualification in composition with other foreign students. Can we not get them into our country? They will serve our cause much better than there. Why are they denied this opportunity? Because we have no openings here. We should make efforts to bring them here. They have been working for 10 or 15 years in some factories in foreign countries and we are permitting our factories in foreign countries and we are permitting our factories and the public sector to draw upon I.A.S officers for management. I.A.S. officers are good for working in administrative jobs but for working in the factories they are of no use. Therefore import those 300 or 400 students who are residing in those foreign countries who are working in those factories after acquiring their degrees in competition with foreign students by even giving them their terms if necessary. I think the terms offered to the Indian Administrative Service or the Indian Police Service should be different from what should be offered to technical personnel. It should be so because if a man is properly trained he can reduce the cost in the factor by 10 per cent. A reduction of 10 per cent in the cost of production will go a long way. If for example the original cost is about a crore of rupees then this would mean a saving of ten lakhs of rupees. This is done purely by their technical genius and this genius has gone out of the country. This should be brought back and they should be taken on their own terms if necessary. First of all those engineers and other technicians who are working in Foreign countries should be persuaded to come here. We are working under a system wherein we get only the I.A.S. officers and not others. We should ask our Ambassadors to make a list of such persons; they will be satisfied to work in India on a much lower salary. Even if you get a very highly qualified man from our factories the Union Public Service Commission does not endorse his application.",
129: "Sir this Bill has met with such general approval throughout the country that it does not stand in need of any long introduction from me. The Lok Sahayak Sena has been functioning during the last eighteen months. It has aroused great enthusiasm. It is now public knowledge that our aim for the present is to train a lakh of people every year. The scheme is for five years and we mean to do this by means of holding some 500 camps in a year. We use ten months of the year avoiding the monsoon seasons. And we hold these camps in different part of India in practically every State. One camp was held in Jammu and Kashmir and we have also camps down south everywhere with huge areas which are generally close to community welfare project centres. Sometimes the State Governments have represented and emphasized that in order to rouse Public enthusiasm and to awaken public consciousness we should hold these camps in other centres also. In these eighteen months somewhere about a lakh and fifty thousand people have been trained. The response has been very fine and everyone who is between the ages of 18 and 40 is welcome. People generally come from the rural areas and all castes and communities are represented. The camp is for one month and the conditions under which the trainees live are military conditions. Free ration is given and free uniforms are given and when the camp is dispersed an out-of-pocket allowance of Rs.15 per head is given to the trainees. I have visited them and I imagine some hon’ble Members might have seen these camps too. The conditions under which the trainees live are just like military conditions and they lead during that one month a fairly strenuous life. Military training is imparted. There is physical drill there are the marches rifle shooting and all that. To those who are not literate an effort is made to give some instruction and particularly instruction in what I may call the art of making a good citizen of India. Our aim is to utilize this one month to create a sense of leadership in every trainee because it is not merely our purpose to give them military training but to make them better citizens and to make them take an active part in the life in their own village. As the House knows throughout the countryside there is a wave of enthusiasm flowing. People are most anxious to help themselves. There is the shradman movement. There is a desire to build roads and dams and to spread the gospel of education and what we require is leadership in the village itself a sense of discipline in the village and we are hoping that this training that we impart apart from the purpose that it may serve in times of need whenever there is an emergency in peace time also the training will be useful and it will rebound to the benefit of the country at large. All this costs a lot of money. The annual expenditure is a crore of rupees and for five years if we proceed on these very lines it will be Rs. 5 crores. This Bill has become necessary because we wanted to have some rules and regulations and while these trainees were living in a camp life they had to be subject to military discipline and therefore we wanted to put it on a regular basis. The Bill as it stands commits Government and commits the Parliament to no limitations. I wish to emphasise this because if the movement spreads and if there is a general desire in the country throughout the community for military training if there is such a general desire for expansion and if Parliament approves of it then within this very Bill it will be possible to extend the number from one lakh a year to two lakhs a year. It will all be a question of money. It will be a question of the provisions to be made for training purposes. I wish also to emphasise here that we are giving one month’s training. The House will be aware that this movement for giving military training has had its origin during the last three or four years on some scale. The House knows that apart from this Lok Sahayak Sena during the last four or five years effort is being made to give military training to various classes of our people for instance we had in our schools and colleges the N.C.C. movement. The N.C.C. course imparts military training and from among them boys are sent up to the Military Academy at Khadakvasla near Poona. Similarly we have opened the auxiliary Cadet Corps and for the purpose of providing military training to the people living in urban areas and employed in industrial concerns mills and factories we have the Territorial Army. And in order to provide better and further means and greater facilities we started the Auxiliary Cadet Corps in 1953. But it was on a limited scale. The period of camp life was about a week in the beginning. I think it was extended to ten days and the allowance paid was Rs. 5. The response to it was great. People were very ready to come and take advantage of it. Then this Lok Sahayak Sena was started and a longer period of training was provided. I am mentioning all this because if experience proves that the period is too short that it should be a bit longer then there will be nothing to prevent the Government with the approval of Parliament from extending the period from one month to two months so as to make the military training effective. Hon’ble Members have seen that the Bill is what you call generally of a providing character. It is a piece of delegated legislation. It says that the prescribed authority shall do this.",
130: "Sir coming to revenue receipts I feel the Railways can earn a sizeable revenue if they tone administration cut down wasteful expenditure repair wagons and coaches in time to increase their life span which would save huge expenditure. Otherwise these wagons and coaches would be disposed of as scrap iron. I suggest more sheds and more repair workshops are to be established and timely repair work is to be taken up. The Railways should also control thousands of ticketless travelers and revenue can also increase by checking damage to railway property wagon-breaking and theft by anti-social elements for which huge compensation is being paid by them. Vast land adjoining railway lines has been illegally occupied and if this land can be reoccupied and can be properly utilised then the Railways will be able to earn more revenue. Indian Railways received a World Bank loan of 400 million dollars. Besides the Railways have received 190 million dollars as loan for the Asian Development Bank for LOCO procurement and for importing new technologies and the Exim Bank of Japan co-financed the loan with 100 million dollar credit. Nothing has been stated about this loan as to how it was utilised and this fund should have accountability at least to the Members of this August House and the Railways should work vigorously to promote tourism by providing a mode of transportation which is not only economical but has a special fascination for the tourists. For this purpose the hon’ble Minister will have to work in consultation with the Minister of Civil Aviation and also the States and this will help the Railways to earn more revenue. I understand the Indian Railways are a founder Member of ESCAP that is Economic and Social Commission of Asia and the Pacific. Since the Indian Railways enjoy international cooperation I would like to know whether this relation has further improved so as to receive more funds from them for overall development of the Railways and also for the technological upgradation modernization of the Railway system and also whether any exchange programme for technical assistance has been formulated as this would considerably help the Indian Railways to improve the existing infrastructure the technological upgradation of the network upgradation of the communication network and computer-based freight operation system and more computerization of passenger reservations in metropolitan towns. I believe funds that would be available through international cooperation may be utilised for improvement purposes and for increasing revenue and it would not be necessary to hike passenger fares and freight charges as proposed in the Budget. In the Annual Report and Accounts 1988-89 of the Indian Railways detailed information on research and development has been given on pages 34 to 38. It has been mentioned that the Research Design and Standard Organisation functions as adviser and consultant to help the Indian Railways in all technical matters. Scientists technologists educationists and senior executives are in this body. I would like to suggest that in this regard – i.e. in technical matters and in connection with the technical improvement and technological upgradation – the Indian Railways should work for research and development in collaboration with IITs Universities and National Metallurgical Laboratories and other national laboratories under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. More research and development centres need to be opened for which there should be provision in the Budget. It should provide funds for further technological developments. Now Madam coming to the question of railway safety I regret to point out that we have not been able as yet to completely eliminate railway accidents or even to substantially reduce them. Only a few days back the Railway Minister made a statement regarding a serious accident involving the Dehradun-Bombay. Central Express which took place on the 14th of this month. To my mind the possibilities of rail accidents can be substantially brought down by an all-round vigilance of the operation staff and by enhancing operational efficiency. I do not know if it is possible to evolve some sort of foolproof arrangement whereby a train moving on the line can receive back positive signal through ultrasonic system about the existence of another moving train from the opposite direction. Such ultrasonic systems are used by navigators in order to protect their ships against accidents with ice-berg. Can similar signaling system not be used in trains also so that accidents can be avoided? The Hon’ble Minister has mentioned about passenger amenities. At present the long distance passengers even in super-fast trains do not get reasonable comforts during their journey. Many unauthorized passengers from the intermediate stations without any reservation forcibly get into reserved compartments and disturb the bona-fide passengers and more often the railway staff are unable to provide any relief. This is very unfair and should be put an end to. Especially now when there is a steep increase in the railway fares the Railway Minister should look into the comforts of passengers. I would also like to mention that the passengers should get amenities like having pure drinking water good food and some entertainment. I have observed in foreign countries that there are film shows or some such entertainment for long distance passengers. I think there should be some arrangements for entertainment here also in the near future. I don’t want to take much time of the House and I think there should be some improvement in the Railway catering service and also some sort of relief must be there for the long-distance passengers. Reservation should be properly done. While concluding Madam I would like to say that the Railway staff should be given more amenities like housing medicare and education so that they can live comfortably as they are rendering great service to the nation. With these words Madam I conclude and I thank you once again for giving me an opportunity to speak on this matter.",
131: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir through this Proclamation we are discussing the problem of a very important unit of this country where the President’s rule has been promulgated. While supporting the Resolution I want to make some observations not only on Mizoram but on the entire North-Eastern region where the political situation continues to cause concern for this country. Very often we talk about insurgency but to me in the North-Eastern region even before Independence we were fighting for the identity people were asserting and we were asserting for our very survival in this country. By nature tribals are very sensitive and they are very suspicious as far as their identity is concerned. In this wide Indian culture naturally the tribal people in the North-Eastern region have felt that unless they assert their identity they would become totally submerged and they would become second-rate citizens in the country. That was the fear that they apprehended and it grew over the years. Another movement – I do not call it insurgency – was a political movement in Nagaland by which they had adopted a policy of non-violence peaceful approach to the solution of the problem but when they were pushed to the wall they had to take up arms and they never called themselves Naga Army – they called themselves Safeguards. It was a part of the undivided Assam. Because of the police action they had to defend themselves and gradually it had developed into a political movement and they had to take up arms to defend themselves to protect themselves to protect the village. In this way this kind of political movement continued not only in Nagaland but also in other parts of the North-Eastern region. This was followed by Mizoram. Then again Manipur and today this malady has been spread to Assam also. So do not take it only from the point of view of insurgency. I would urge this August House that the feelings aspirations the longings of these tribals in the North-Eastern region have got something to do with their survival for their existence. May I state here that in Nagaland though it is a small State it is a small tribe we have our own history we have our own political background and it was no other leader than late Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru who recognised the identity of the Nagaland it was Pandit Nehru who gave that political identity to Naga people. And therefore the Naga People even now remember how great was Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. He was a father of the down-trodden; he was a father of the people there. Let us come to Meghalaya. The same agitation was going on but fortunately Meghalaya could emerged without shedding any blood and through a peaceful process the State of Meghalaya was carved out. And this was given by no other person than Mrs. Indira Gandhi. Mizoram emerged after more than two decades of struggle under the leadership of Laldenga; they had been fighting for secession from India. It was through the good offices of the Government of India the people of India and also the political wisdom of Laldenga that he came round to join the mainstream of national life. Why should we not give credit to Laldenga for this? It was he who took the step that we should be a part and parcel of the Indian Union. Shall we not give him the credit? So I would request the hon’ble Members not to utter any uncharitable words against Laldenga just because there is President’s rule there. Whether President’s rule is there or the elected government is there Laldenga is also there. How could he come to power after the last election? I would remind this august House that the tribal people are very considerate. It was Mr. Laldenga who highlighted or projected the Mizos in the eyes of the people of India and the World. Mizo people are proud people very hardworking people and they know what is best for them. Therefore when this accord was signed the Mizo intellectuals and the Mizo people said why not give chance to our leader Mr. Laldenga he fought for us; he lived in difficult conditions for us. And they brought him to power. His party was given the mandate by the people. But Sir administration of guerilla people is quite different from a normal administration. In a guerilla warfare in a guerilla movement there is might that is the destiny of an individual the fate of an individual the fate of an organization. But in a normal administration where we have to function under the Constitution of India we have to be governed by normal rules and regulations and procedures. Here I believe Mr. Laldenga who has been used only to the guerilla methods when he was given the reins of normal administration felt the difficulties of running a normal administration. He could not satisfy not only his M.L.As. his partymen but also his followers because one can promise heaven one can promise the sun and the moon but in actual implementation one cannot satisfy the feelings the aspirations and the urges of all the people who follow him when he was leading a political movement. Similar is the case in Assam. AGP promised so many things to the people but when you are given the actual reins of administration you are bound to fumble. So they are also suffering. Similar is the case with Laldenga. Don’t blame only the Congress Government defection was not by Congress people; it was among his own colleagues among his own men. About this anti-defection law I think the philosophy behind it is also full of defects and loopholes. When an individual is killed we call it murder; but in a war when we kill thousands we don’t call it murder. Similar is the case with anti-defection law. Therefore this House should do some rethinking on this.",
132: "Mr. Chairman Sir Shri Chavan presented the Union Budget for the first time in his political career. Shri Chavan is a very experienced politician and an able administrator. He has held a number of important positions in the past. He has been the Chief Minister of a progressive State like Maharashtra Home Minister and Minister of Defence at the Centre and held a number of other positions. I am impressed by his abilities since long. The way be gave an account of his experience and farsightedness while presenting his maiden Budget is indeed commendable. This budget is commendable and significant in many respects. The tempo maintained by the Government since 1980 for alleviating poverty and providing employment to the people is praiseworthy. The efforts of the Government have resulted in an increase in these activities year after year and this too is commendable. But this year the hon’ble Minister has broken all previous records as he has given special impetus to the poverty alleviation programme in the Budget. The most significant among all these programmes is the Jawaharlal Nehru Rozgar Yojana under which there is a proposal to provide employment to one member in each family in 120 districts. It is in itself a revolutionary step. Our party has decided that employment must be given to at least one person in each poor family all over the country. Though details of the programme as to how this scheme will be implemented and how employment will be provided are still to come before us yet I would like to praise this bold decision the benefits of which will reach lakhs and crores of people throughout the country and will provide relief to them. A number of concessions have been given to poor people in this Budget with a view to providing them relief but at the same time it gave a setback to the middle class. So far as I can understand the Budget will in no way affect the rich people. First of all I would like t draw the attention of the hon’ble Minister to poverty alleviation programmes because the Government is earmarking huge funds for these programmes. Now it becomes the duty of the Central Government to see that the money reaches the people properly. It is not to-day only but for years that the hon’ble Members have been expressing the view that the beneficiaries do not receive the full amount of money that is earmarked for them. There could have been some difference of opinion had even 25 per cent of the funds reached the people. But it is an acknowledged fact and the Government even the Prime Minister had admitted that the money released from the Centre under poverty alleviation programs or employment programmes does not reach the people. It is all the more distressing that in spite of the fact that we agree with this view and know everything so far no effective step have been taken to ensure that the full amount reaches the people. Only two agencies are involved in this work. The Central Government allocates the money and the State Governments implement the programmes. It is the Central Government that knows the extent to which the guidelines issued by them are followed by the State Governments. One thing is certain that once the money reaches the district and block level the Central Government has no control over it. It is said that monitoring is being done. But how and in what way it is done? So far I have not seen any representative of the Central Government going to the block level and verifying the work done or enquiring from the people and listening to them. The Central Government has not taken any steps in this regard. The Hon’ble Prime Minister has also been saying that out of six rupees only one rupee reaches the people and the remaining amount is spent on administration. I would like to cite the instance of Uttar Pradesh. In this state there is a District Development Officer in each district to look after the development works. Nowadays all works have come to a standstill. The officers have no work to do. The District Rural Development Agency a parallel agency has its parallel office and parallel staff. But the agencies of the State government are silent. Nobody knows what they are doing except attending to routine administrative work. Most of the State Governments do not undertake any development work out of their own resources. Construction of roads in rural areas is the primary work of the State Governments. But no State Government is utilising its resources on construction of roads in rural areas. They are undertaking this work with the funds received from the Central Government. Salaries are being paid and expenditure is being incurred but the Department of the State Government is sitting idle with no work. Is it not possible for the concerned Department of the State Government to undertake this work? It could have been converted into the District Rural Development Agency. What is the need of separate departments separate bureaucrats and separate staff? The entire funds are being spent on the maintenance of staff. Hon’ble Minister of Finance might be aware that the State Governments do not want to mobilise resources. They are not imposing any fresh taxes. We come to know from newspapers and A.I.R. and T.V. news that such and such State passed a tax free Budget. Today no State is prepared to impose any tax. They want to undertake all the works with the funds received from the Centre. Every State whether it is the Congress ruled or non-Congress ruled alleges that the Central Government is discriminating against it. It has become a tendency with the State Governments not to levy any taxes. They want to depend entirely on funds given by the Centre. All the State Governments whether it is the Congress or the non-Congress Government want to avail of the credit facility.",
133: "Mr. Chairman Sir may I have the opportunity to participate in this debate? This is a private Member’s Bill and I want to congratulate the mover of this Bill for having brought this Bill. A very important subject has been raised that right to work should be made a fundamental right. Right to work is the birthright of everybody however poor or however rich whether a man or a woman. We have right to property as a fundamental right in our country but it is really sad that right to work which provides right to live should not be made a fundamental right and should only be a Directive Principle. Why has this happened? Why could it not be made a fundamental right till now? It is known that once it becomes a fundamental right it becomes justiciable. That means that a person can go to the High Court or the Supreme Court and say that it is his fundamental right and he must get a job. But as the Government was not sure that it would be able to provide employment to every citizen it did not do so. Because a fundamental right cannot be made only for a particular age group; it is for all citizens and every unemployed citizen can come to the court and claim his right for a job to be given to him. That was the real apprehension reluctance on the part of the Government but this helps us to raise a larger economic issue of how we can create conditions in our country where every work worthy person would have a job. It is this subject which is being debated and this is what should be debated as the most important subject in the Parliament and in the country today. Unfortunately I find very few people taking interest in this. Today if we just introspect and sit a little coolly and consider how much energy is being wasted on trying to win debating points trying to be sensational trying to have mere superficial debate in this country we will find that we are doing that too much. But the real issue is how to provide employment to every young man of this country because after all what is socialism. When we say that we have pledged ourselves in the Preamble that we will establish a democratic socialist secular sovereign Republic what does it mean? What is socialism? It means all members of our society must have an equal opportunity to live a decent human life. Such conditions must be created in our society where every single individual should have that right. That is the simple meaning of the word socialism a society where a few do not have an opportunity and a right to exploit and extort. Such a society should be created and this is what socialism means. And to bring it about within the framework of a democratic structure i.e. by the will of the people is the meaning of the concept which our founding fathers have enshrined in the Constitution when they said that we will have a democratic socialist society. Let us ask ourselves this question. Have we succeeded in doing it? When I am participating in the debate today I am not going to speak from the point of view of winning or scoring the debating points between people on this side or that side. I think it is the duty of all of us. These 800 people in this House and in that House who have been entrusted by 80 crores of people of this country with the task of doing something that will change their destiny and change their life it is incumbent on us to sit down and to give the topmost priority to consider as to how we can achieve this. And if this is given priority Sir I am sure a way can be found. Instead of wasting our energy on other matters let us concentrate on this matter. I am absolutely one with my friends when they say that this should be given the top priority. What do the young people of this country expect? Why are they restive? Why are they frustrated? It is because they are not employed. they do not have productive employment creative employment. That is why they feel frustrated. By and large if this is the fact Sir then let us consider how this can be achieved. If you want to provide employment that employment must be productive. What is wealth? Wealth is goods and services. It is not notes the currency notes are actually the means of exchange. The wealth is goods. When do you say that a man is poor? It is when he is not able to have even the necessities of life.Mr. Chairman Sir may I have the opportunity to participate in this debate?

134: "In view of the recommendations made by the Backward Classes Commission the Government of India examined the matter in consultation with the State Governments concerned. This is exactly what we have decided and what has been incorporated in the present Bill. As a result it has been decided that in the case of Rajasthan the area restriction should be removed altogether because in Rajasthan this population has been spread over a very large area. It was found that they were entitled to this measure of protection and therefore this area restriction has not been kept up in respect of Rajasthan at all. In the case of the other two States namely Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh the tribes residing in tehsils where there is concentration of twenty per cent or more of tribal population should be specified as Scheduled Tribes. This is point number two so far as the salient recommendations of the Backward Classes Commission were concerned. Then Sir the third point was regarding the actual omissions or actual additions. There were a number of communities. In respect of this there are certain difficulties also which I shall be pointing out very soon. So far as the Backward Classes Commission’s recommendations in this respect were concerned there were certain natural handicaps. When we received their recommendations regarding either additions or omissions naturally we had to depend upon the well-considered views of the State Governments. As I stated to the House there was a double reference. The first reference was at the preliminary stage and the second reference was with regard to the tentative proposals that the Government had evolved. Therefore in this case after the receipt of the views of the State Governments the Government of India finally re-cast what they had prepared in the light of these views. Generally what has been done is when there has been a recommendation which is supported both by the Backward Classes Commission and the State Government then we accept that particular community either for addition if formerly it was not there or for omission if omission has been jointly supported by both these people. If for example there is a difference of opinion between them then the Government considered the matter. I would point out that the State Governments have a number of means of knowing the correct position so far as these are concerned. So far as the Backward Classes Commission was concerned there were certain handicaps as pointed out to you. And therefore we have tried to follow the views of the State Governments to the extent that it is necessary. In a few cases naturally we had to come to certain conclusions irrespective of the view either of the Backward Classes Commission or of the State Governments. But such cases are not many. And then after considering all these things we have prepared the list and you will find in the Schedule attached to the Bill the names of the various communities which ought to be recognized so far as either the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes are concerned. One more important question arises so far as the number of these communities is concerned. That was a very difficult task. Now what happened in 2011 was naturally representations were made to the Government that we ought to give up encouraging or perpetuating caste system. And therefore when the 2011 census had to be prepared the question arose as to whether Government should have the enumeration through their officers in respect of the members of the separate castes as well or whether the enumeration should be confined to the groups or categories of Scheduled Castes as a whole and Scheduled Tribes as a whole. For example take a particular community the Bhil community. In some of the former census we had these communities shown separately. But in the 2011 census on account of the decision that the Government took there was this view that we should not go on perpetuating the various castes and tribes. The desire was to amalgamate all of them under these two recognized heads namely the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Therefore a separate enumeration as ‘Bhil’ was not generally mentioned. I am mentioning only one community not the others. What was done was when the man stated that he belonged to a particular tribe or a caste then the enumerator found out whether he was one of the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes recognised by the President’s Order. Then his name was shown in the category of Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes without mentioning the special community. Afterwards this Commission was appointed. One of the results of the appointment of this Commission was naturally the accentuation of the emphasis on castes and tribes. Every community began to plead because after all certain rights were given. This political right of representation was also given. And therefore every community thought it advisable to claim that either they were a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe.",
135: "Now Sir I know that this Plan has just started and it is perhaps too early for us to say anything about it. But we have before us the experience of the Nine Five Year Plan. Sir we had been told that due importance would be attached not merely in words but by practical steps to the public sector. I think in this connection it was the duty of the hon’ble Minister to have explained to this House as to the steps that had been taken with a view to bringing about the kind of reorientation in favour of the public sector which was promised in his numerous statements. But I find that that is completely missing from his speech except that a pious wish has been expressed with regard to this particular sector of our industry. Previously we had under the purview of this Act about 42 industries. Now the list has lengthened and a number of industries will be added. I concede that when we are having a planned economy when we are thinking in terms of rapid development of industries of rapid industrialization it is necessary for the Government to come into the picture more and more and assume the necessary control and direction of industries. I am not opposed to it at all. On the contrary I would like them to vigorously act in this matter but that is not enough. We must examine as to whether the direction regulation –or whatever you call it –is on the right lines; how it has worked. We have got such general statements from the Ministers that they do not throw much light for us laymen on the matter. I wish that when such measures are brought before the House a kind of white paper or whatever you call it is circulated among the Members. You do not expect that we laymen in this House would easily understand these things until and unless we have some opportunities of studying the relevant data and the material on the subject. We have been denied those opportunities and I regret that we have been so denied. I know that in this respect hon’ble Members who come from big business or the business world would be in a somewhat advantageous position because they are familiar with the working of this Act in a way which would enable them to speak more effectively. Now let us see how this has worked. I know that when this measure was first brought before the House several years ago there was much opposition to it which came not from the public but from certain business interests. They did not like any kind of Government interference in industry. They believed in a kind of laissez faire in this matter and they thought that if the Government came into the picture their interests would suffer. Naturally they were openly hostile to these kinds of powers for the Government but that was not the view of the country. I think that by and large public opinion was in favour of Government controlling industries not the type of control that we had at the time of the World War but a type of control which sets before itself certain objectives and as the objectives became clearer and clearer as the Government pronounced itself more and more in favour of industrialization in the country public opinion strongly veered round that particular point of view of the Government in this matter viz. that Government should have control over our industries. But it is the Government which has not lived up to its promises. I think that in some respects they have let the people down and the expectations of the people have been belied. Now take for instance the period between 1991 when the measure was first adopted and now. What do we see? We do not have compact figures for the entire period. We have got only certain figures with regard to this matter. I would refer only to the Progress Reports on the Seventh Five Year Plan. There you will see that the Government had not taken any very effective steps for the development of the public sector. It is true that certain steel mills got going under the Seventh Five Year Plan and more will be started under the Eighth Plan but if you look at the picture you will find that the public sector was considered to be a secondary matter. It was the private sector which got all the attention and assistance of the Government. I am not at all suggesting that Government was totally unmindful of the public sector. What I am saying is that when the Government entered into the picture it did not give to the public sector the attention that it deserved. I think that the hon’ble Minister owes us an explanation not only as to why such a thing happened but also as to what steps he is going to take with a view to changing the pattern of such development.",
136: "Now about the Secretaries. Generally there is one for each Department and he wants Joint Secretaries Deputy Secretaries and so on. There is a whole army of Secretaries; I do not know how many we have got. It is very difficult to keep pace with the growth of the Secretaries in our administration. When the British left there were a few; now there are too many. I am not at all suggesting that the number should not have increased. Our Prime Minister is quite right in saying that the administrative work has increased many times 50 to 100. I do not know whether it is 50 to 100 times. But much of the work is not worth having because if you assess the work properly then you will find some of the useless things need not be there at all. However I concede that point that we would require perhaps more ministerial servants in the various Departments –more Under Secretaries Assistants stenographers clerks and so on. I concede that point. But are we not having too many Secretaries? I know what work they are doing. Is there any proper check on that? Most of the work that goes in their name is actually done by people about whom we never discuss whose merit we do not take into account who are much maligned in the public administration of our country the men in the lower rung of the ladder of this public administration. These Assistants and others do a lot of work and it is a very good thing. We are a cultured people we are a civilized people and we are a people with initiative. Now when they feel that they are the functionaries of the Government of a free country naturally they would like to put their very best and in fact they are doing so. Unfortunately their efficiency is not given either due recognition or due incentive which is required in order to tone up the administration and improve the affairs in our public administration. We should reject this idea of administration by the Secretaries. We have got a Parliament; we have got a Ministry which is supposed to be responsible to the Parliament. Howsoever irresponsibly at times it may behave constitutionally it is supposed to be responsible to Parliament. And then we have got a big administrative set-up of the Government of India. There are people of efficiency people who are not recognised who nevertheless discharge their duties efficiently. We want to improve the pace of the administration; we want to democratize our administration. That is the crux of the problem. You cannot have initiative and efficiency until you have our administration democratized. There is bureaucracy; there is soullessness at every point in our administration. I do not know how many of you have talked to the Secretaries of the various Departments. I have talked to some of the Secretaries but sometime I feel as if I were talking to the useless persons. One does not see any reaction on their face I feel that it is a machine that I am talking to. It depresses me and I am sure many other people also feel depressed. So all these Secretaries of these Departments have to be democratized and they should be responsive to criticism and to the wished of the public. It all depends on how you talk to the public how you listen to them what you gather from what the people say. Not that always they say the right things but sometimes they say very good things and such things should be properly gathered. This is not done. Therefore what is of vital importance for us for improving the public administration in our country is to democratize the administration and do away with the bureaucratic cold-bloodedness that exists in our public administration today. That is of vital importance. I stress it again and again because the crux of the problem lies there. Initiative has to be developed at the lower level by entrusting more responsibilities to the lower officials and by giving recognition to their services and also making it easy for them to work. Their conditions of service have to be improved. Their emoluments must be made adequate to make their life worth living. All these things are important for improving our public administration. As far as the public undertakings are concerned I am totally opposed to the bureaucrats or representatives of the big money being placed in positions of authority in public administration. There are people no matter to which politics they belong who are efficient who are devoted and who can discharge their functions very ably in all walks of life. You can find people from among the common folk who could be placed in those positions. Sir life insurance has been nationalized. What do we find there? It is a public undertaking of great importance to the country. There you have got the same people; the old furniture is placed with some sort of rearrangement.",
137: "Before putting forward a measure of this nature before Parliament we had given considerable thought to certain aspects of cloth prices as they exist today and it is only because we felt that this is the only means now open to us which can to some extent act as a deterrent against high prices and where it fails to do so would be able to absorb the margins of profit that go to the trade and industry that we sought to bring in this measure for the approval of Parliament. Sir the factual position which has been described in the note might be summarized thus. The existing capacity of the mills is being utilized to the maximum possible extent. In fact Sir in July the production of textiles has been an all-time record of 500 million metres. Hon’ble Members might say “Well if that is possible why do you fear that there is going to be scarcity of cloth?” In fact I think it is the possible scarcity and the high prices that have induced these people to stretch a point and make the mills produce a little more though certain factors helping to increase production have been accidental namely in July the working days have been the largest in number. The other fact is Sir that we are not in a position within any measurable distance of time to increase the capacity of the mills both in regard to its loomage that is weaving and in regard to its spindlage that is spinning because the loomage in the mills is frozen. We are not adding to the looms except for the recent decision that we have taken that we should add to the mills by way of automatic looms intended specifically for promotion of export of cloth and so far as spindlage is concerned that has been restricted to an increase over a period of 1-1/2 years to about 2 million spindles the licence for bulk of which has already been granted and this decision had been taken on the basis of an estimate of consumption of 18 metres per capita during the Eighth Five Year Plan and towards the end of it. When that decision was taken Sir Government were not unconscious of the fact that that target would not be a correct one and in an expansionist economy that target is likely to be exceeded but that target figure was tentatively accepted mainly because it happened to coincide with the recommendation of a committee which inter alia dealt with the requirements of the people in regard to cloth that is the Ramamoorthy Committee and therefore Sir if the guilt is laid at the doors of Government I will have to plead guilty namely that we were not in a position to envisage the rapid expansion of consumption. The figures that I have furnished to hon’ble Members will indicate that while the consumption figures per capita last year that is for 1995 would be below 16 metres there has been a rise during the first half. It is quite likely that unless the price factor the scarcity factor and other factors operate to diminish the total consumption the rate of consumption might increase. Of course there is undoubtedly a limiting factor because cloth has to come either by inhibiting exports or by an increase in production or by an increase in the handloom sector; and in these three cases we have almost reached the maximum point where we can expect additions to the total cloth consumption. So it is possible that cloth consumption might go up to 17 metres and is not likely to go beyond that merely because of the fact that cloth will not be there. Probably if the cloth is available and if we allow people to consume the cloth freely well the consumption per capita might exceed 17 metres by the end of the year. But it is certainly indicative of the fact that in the first year of the Plan we have only got a margin of one metre per capita. We have also got to realise that the amount of money that is being pumped into the country and to some extent into the hands of the lower income groups will have one effect namely certain commodities like cloth and sugar and commodities of that sort which have been considered to be not necessities in the past and have therefore elastic features in consumption would become more or less articles of necessity and be transferred from the semi-luxury state. In such a case 20 or 21 metres seems to be well within our possibility of achievement as a target. There is undoubtedly Sir a background behind this restrictive attitude in regard to addition of capacity and that is to some extent sentimental and to some extent economic and deliberate. We want to help the decentralized sector in this industry; the handloom sector has to obtain protection against the weaving mills.",
138: "Then Sir some attempt has been made to introduce certain elements in the present Constitution (Amendment) Bill but naturally other details and further elucidations are out of the purview of the present Bill and therefore a new Bill will have to be brought forward to the extent that it is necessary for incorporating these provisions. In the meanwhile I would assure the House that Government have made arrangements and will take steps for having interim advisory bodies etc. so far as all these areas are concerned and then immediately in the next session or if that were not possible in the session after the next an attempt would be made to place before this House a Bill or Bills for broadly carrying out the scheme especially the administrative scheme that I have explained to this House. There will of course be in addition to these bodies so far as Delhi is concerned a Delhi Development Authority. All these are necessary because Delhi is the capital and all attempts have to be made to make Delhi as model a city as possible. Now the next item with which this Bill deals is what is known as the safeguards for linguistic minorities. Now this would apply to all the States. So far as this is concerned there are two or three aspects to this question. One is that we are dealing only with linguistic minorities not any other minorities at all and we are generally following the line that has been laid down by the States Reorganisation Commission. The States Reorganisation Commission rightly pointed out that even after the reorganization of States there would remain a large population speaking languages other than the territorial language of the particular State. Now so far as these people are concerned certain safeguards were considered essential. In the first place we have to note that all the inhabitants in any part of India State or Union Territory are the citizens of India. They have a common citizenship and the rights of common citizenship will naturally be available in all respects so far as the linguistic minorities in different parts are concerned. But it is essential that as far as possible the interests of the linguistic minorities should be safeguarded to the extent that it is necessary. The States Reorganisation Commission have pointed out in this respect that after all these linguistic minorities are the citizens of India. Now Sir so far as the States Reorganisation Commission was concerned it was stated that as far as possible there ought to be no statutory safeguards as such except to the minimum extent and whatever it has stated has been accepted. It was stated that in respect of the rights of the children of these linguistic minorities there ought to be a statutory provision and that they ought to be taught through the medium of their own mother-tongue at the primary school level. Now that has been accepted. As the House will find a new provision has been made in the Bill so far as the secondary education stage is concerned and so far as the other questions are concerned. The other questions are many as for example to what extent there should be the language of a minority as a medium of examination in middle schools and in colleges; or whether it should also be a medium of administration in Government offices. Now Sir there is another question also which has been raised namely the question of domiciliary rules. There are certain States where certain rules are made according to which it may be difficult for the non-residents in that area to acquire certain rights. In some cases very long periods have been laid down. If I mistake not in one case 12 years residence was prescribed and that was considered rather inequitable. As you are aware Sir in this respect the Constitution has stated that if for example there are any such rules which had the force of law at the time when the Constitution was inaugurated then they would continue to have the force of law until Parliament makes a law in that respect. We are considering that aspect of the question also. Then Sir the important question that has to be noted is that if we have a common citizenship then the question arises whether it would be open or it ought to be open to the various State Governments to lay down certain rules which are likely to be complained of as discriminatory provisions so far as the acquisition of property is concerned or so far as the admission to Government services is concerned. Therefore Sir the whole subject is under the consideration of the Government of India and we are anxious to evolve certain provisions. Therefore Sir coming back to the linguistic minorities what has been decided is this. It was suggested that the Governor should have the right of finding out the solution for this and giving property rights to all citizens in this State.",
139: "Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir there is a ban on transporting agricultural produce from one part to another part of the country. During the last session the hon’ble Minister had announced that this ban will be lifted but it has not been done till now. The farmers are unable to take their produce to any part of the country. As a result of total neglect towards agriculture the allocation given to this field has decreased form 4 per cent to 3 per cent in the annual plan outlay. The allocation for National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development is going down in every annual plan in comparison to the annual plan of 1992-93. Similarly only 6 per cent amount has been provided for loans and electricity. There has been so considerable increase in it in the last year. This step of the Government is totally unjustified towards the farmers and agriculture. The continuous decrease in the ground water level is also a matter of grave concern. Ever since the Congress Party has come to power there has been 10 per cent difference between the estimated capacity and actual utilization of irrigation potential. If this gap had been filled it would have increased the food grain production. Not only our country would have become self-reliant in food grains but it would have been also able to export them. Several big projects are lying pending and near about 70 per cent of land is deprived of irrigation. Same is the condition of forest areas also. Wherever there are Congress Governments they have grossly violated the interests of the farmers. The network of multinational companies is spreading in our country which will create problems for the farmers. Their interest are being mortgaged in the hands of foreign powers. Due to this reason the country is becoming dependent on others and it can jeopardise our political and social freedom. Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir it is bad luck that our farmers are not organised today. But the day they become organised they can revolt. Since the time this Congress Government has been formed it is not even ready to accept rightful demands. Unless such activities as sabotage economic blockade and gherao are adopted the Government is not able to understand the problem. So I would like the Government not to create so much problem for the farmers that they are compelled to revolt. Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir my party and myself totally oppose the Dunkel proposals. It is very regretful that these proposals have caused infighting among the Cabinet members. One of your Ministers says that the export of our country will increase with the acceptance of Dunkel proposals and another Minister says that such acceptance will destroy our country. So there is difference of opinion in the Cabinet also. One Minister is opposing while another Minister is supporting the Dunkel Proposals. When there is so much difference of opinion in the Cabinet itself what right they have to remain in Government? One of the two Ministers should go; the Minister who is opposing his Government’s policy should resign. If the Government is not accept the Dunkel proposals the Agricultural Minister should resign and if the Government is not accepting the proposals the Commerce Minister should resign as he was praising the proposals. When the farmers resort to agitation for their demands the entire Government will have to resign. Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir our country is severely affected by drought at present. Orissa Bihar Maharashtra and eastern part of Uttar Pradesh are affected by drought but our Central Government decides everything in a haphazard manner. The Prime Minister surveys a State for once and gives Rs. 10 crores Rs. 20 crores or Rs. 50 crores. Then he goes to another State. Such a haphazard manner cannot solve the problem. There should be a permanent solution. Even after 65 years of Independence the Government has not been able to control drought. Maximum rain water is wasted and there is no storage facility. Sir Andhra Pradesh is also severely affected by drought and the situation has become so worse that the farmers are forced to kill their own children. Neither there is fodder nor water for their cattle. Sir it is just opposite in Karnataka. It is affected by floods which have caused a lot of damage. On the one hand there is devastation due to heavy rains; on the other hand there is suffering due to drought. I have read the draft of the agriculture policy. I do not think that the hon’ble Minister of Agriculture has paid any attention towards this problem. I would like to submit that this agriculture policy is unfavorable to the farmers. No facilities are being provided to them and agricultural inputs are being made costlier. Injustice is being done to them. Eighty per cent of the population of this country are cultivators and the Government should think about their welfare. It this is not done then 80 per cent population will resort to agitation as I have said earlier also.",
140: "Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir at the outset I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to you for having given me an opportunity to participate in this discussion on the Demands for Grants of the Ministry of Agriculture. Sir this Government is going to complete its two years term on 19th June 1993. In the last two years I have been closely watching how this Government is taking keen interest to help this unorganized sector. This is the major rural sector comprising about 70 per cent of the population but in all the three Budgets which they have presented before this House I am sorry to say the Government has not shown any keen interest. In the first Budget we demanded the Government to agree to constitute a Committee to go into pricing policy of fertilizers. Ultimately a portion of the recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee which suited the Government was accepted and the fertilizer decontrol was done. Now I would like to say how this Government has taken a callous attitude towards the farming community. In the last Budget various concessions were given only to the affluent sections of the society and not to the farming community except a reduction of the excise duty on the tractors which are above 1800 cc and the tractors which are below 1800 cc have not been touched. Of course the hon’ble Finance Minister while replying to the general discussion on the Budget had said that the Prime Minister is considering to give certain concessions as far as the fertilizer prices are concerned. All of a sudden what made the Government to reconsider the question of reducing the prices of fertilizers to give some concessions? It is because all these friends who have got various political ideologies have shown their bit of mind and said that this time they are going to move a cut motion to see that the Government agrees to reduce the fertilizer prices. So now at this stage I would like to make an appeal to all sections of the House irrespective of the political parties and to such of those Members who are really interested in uplifting the farming community to forget the party alliance. At the time of voting everyone of the ruling party Members is also equally interested to see that his farming community is given its proper due share. The Central Government claims to have removed all shackles through the new economic policy market economy liberalization de-licensing amendment to the MRTP Act etc. But they have done it only for the industrial sector. Some of those people have been really enjoying the benefit for the last seven Five Year Plans for the last 47 years after Independence. But all these structural reforms or the economic reforms or the export policy changes or whatever they may be they are only having an eye towards those people and these changes have been made for those people. I would like to ask this Government what are the types of structural reforms they have thought over for the farming community. You are amending the MRTP Act. The industrialists can make any amount of investment; the industrialists can make any amount of profit. So there is no restriction for these people. Unfortunately for the people who come from the rural areas or the people who are actually the tillers of the soil they have got all restrictions. They cannot hold land more than ten acres or whatever it may be. Land Reforms Act has been implemented and in some States there may be a little bit of lapses. I do not want to enter into that controversy at this stage. There is no ceiling on income so far as these oppressed sections are concerned. There is no ceiling on income as well as no ceiling on urban land or the urban property. But you have enforced ceiling on agricultural property because they are not the organised people. About lending also I would like to make a mention. Farmers have to go from pillar to post. Various types of financial institutions have been created for financing the farmers. But to what extent are we going to give the financial assistance? We have included the agricultural sector as a priority sector. Only 15 per cent of the bank deposit is going towards the farming community. The agricultural sector contributes about 32 per cent of the GDP whereas the loan or the bank advance is only 15 per cent for this so-called priority sector. So far as industrial sector is concerned it comprises only 18 per cent of the population and their contribution in terms of GDP is hardly 26 per cent. They get about 40 per cent of the bank loan. Again even to get this 15 per cent loan the farmer has to go to land development bank central cooperative bank rural cooperative bank commercial bank and so on.",
141: "Sir when I take part in the discussion first of all I wish to point out that the Sarkaria Commission was not given a free hand to examine the developments which had taken place in the last 40 years in India. The main important point is the terms of reference. By the terms of reference certain parameters had been fixed. Within those parameters the Sarkaria Commission has submitted its report. There are more than 200 recommendations. Due to lack of time it is not possible to deal largely with all these recommendations. But at the same time the Commission has tried to find out the past history of India. The Commission has said that too much centralization was objected to from the Mauryan period to the Mughal period. The Commission has stated the fact. Similarly under the British rule also centralization was actually objected to by the people by the States. The founding fathers of our Constitution were painfully conscious that the feeling of Indian nationhood was still in the making and required to be carefully nurtured. They therefore built a constitutional structure with a powerful Central Government envisaging the emergence of an indivisible and integrated India. The concept of a strong Centre which is necessary to meet India’s immediate needs was virtually in the later period converted into the concept of a unitary State with priority for the Centre in all cases. This was the basis of the process of excessive centralism with all powers in the hands of the Centre. India is developing on the path of capitalism especially monopoly capitalism. When monopoly capitalism develops in a country it is then natural that the general argument will be for centralization of the powers in the hands of the Central Government because they want to protect the interests of the monopoly capitalists and also help the capitalists. So that is the natural argument. This argument has been there for the last so many years. But over-centralisation has taken place and we know that it has taken place. What is the result now? Many are talking about the unity of the county about the integrity of the country. But what has happened in the States? Communal forces have grown divisive forces have grown and the integrity of the country has been jeopardized. When the powers were vested in the hands of the Centre why has the Centre failed? The Khalistan movement is there and there are other movements also secessionist movements. Now some people are demanding a Jharkhand State and then there is a demand for an Uttarakhand State. These are all developing. There was a similar demand in Darjeeling. But fortunately that has been solved now. But other fissiparous tendencies are growing and the Centre has not been able to control them. The Centre has not been able to prevent them. But they think that only for the Centre and not for the States that the unity of the people has to be maintained. The question of Centre-State relations in India is not a question concerned only with the implementation of federal principles or with preventing the violation of those principles or suggesting a few Constitutional amendments but it is concerned with the question of maintaining. Indian unity maintaining and consolidating the sense of Indian-ness or Indian oneness among all the constituents of the Indian Union with the Centre as the expression of that unity. But for maintaining that unity which has enabled us to compel the British to quit the constituent units have not received any reward in the integration of the units because the constituent units consisted of big territories each with its own language and heritage and in these huge linguistic national units their linguistic identity and sense of unity grew side by side with the identity of the Union. So a deep thought has to be bestowed on how to maintain the unity with the support of the people with the support of the States. But that is not the concern of the Central Government. The Sarkaria Commission has been able to make certain recommendations within certain parameters. Even within those parameters two recommendations are there. One is that it is neither advisable nor necessary to make any drastic change in the basic character of the Constitution. The second is that the electoral system can be continued like this. In the second recommendation the Commission says that it certainly calls for improvement and reform in a number of aspects. The actual working of the Constitution leaves much to be desired. It has said about the changes proposed in the financial aspects of the Indian Union and the States. The arrangements are far from being satisfactory. It has said about the role of the Governors reservation of State Bills for consideration of the President use of extraordinary powers etc. The Commission has said about the Inter-Governmental Council with a comprehensive size. It has said about a National Economic Development Council have a nexus with the Planning Commission limitation of the Centrally-sponsored schemes State finance and planning etc. etc.",
142: "There is however one recommendation of the Press Commission which seems to have been omitted when making the provisions of this Bill. The Commission had said that on the Council; representation must be given to the periodical press also i.e. the weeklies and others. I find that omission here. I feel that in our newspaper world these periodicals these monthlies fortnightlies and weeklies do play an important part especially in moulding public opinion and in the dissemination of knowledge. Therefore I think that the recommendation of the Press Commission that some representation ought to be given to the periodical press also must be considered in this connection. It seems to have been omitted here. That is what I have to say at this stage regarding the composition of the Council. Next I come to clause 14 of this Bill which is a very vital clause. I was happy to listen to the hon’ble Minister when he stated that it is the accepted canon of journalistic conduct not to disclose the source of information. If you go through the history of journalism in India you will find that our top men in the newspaper world had refused to divulge the source of information and they had to suffer for it and because of such suffering the prestige and self-respect of the profession have been very much heightened. No journalist worth his salt would disclose the source of his information not because he is so anxious to keep his own self-respect but because he know that it is vital for the profession as a whole. If you want an independent Press if you want your newspapers to play their part in the field of public opinion if you ask them to disclose the source of their information then the very spring of independent journalism would be touched and that is not a desirable thing. The hon’ble Minister has himself explained that point and therefore I need not labour that point any more. I however find that clause 14 expressly lays down that the Council has the power of requiring discovery and production of documents. If you call upon a correspondent or the owner of a paper or a publisher in many cases it would be impossible to withhold the source of information. You cannot withhold the source of information and at the same time discover and produce the documents. We have given notice of an amendment. Even if you want to continue the existing provision you could provide for an exception saying that the journalists must not be required to disclose the source of information. It is not a question of just the newspaper people and the public being apprehensive over these things. Here is a provision which has been expressly put there. Of course you can say that eminent journalists will be there on the Council and that we can expect the leaders of the newspaper world who can be expected to be elected to this Council to pay proper heed to the professional standards but it will be better if you were to put an express provision in the Bill itself. Now the newspapers reflect political opinion of the country and there are bound to be sharp differences and however much we may try it may not be always possible to keep within the limits. By this provision you are giving them a handle to force an unwitting journalist or somebody holding a different view to disclose the source of information that is not called for. Coming to the other general powers of the Press Council it is true as mentioned by the hon’ble Minister himself that the powers granted to this body are far more and go far beyond the powers granted to the British Press Council in the particular statute. I quite follow that. The penal provisions therein have not been called to use. As the Minister himself made it clear it is just a sanction. The body to be created will enable the profession and the industry to regulate themselves. It is some sort of a voluntary thing which is there. A sanction will have its own way but then there is this power to summon witnesses and as I have already mentioned requiring them to produce documents and other things. When you give all these powers at least some of us feel that in the present set-up in our country these powers are a little excessive. They are not called for in the present conditions existing in our newspaper world. Some of these powers have not been found necessary to be given to the British Press Council even and yet we are investing our Press Council with such powers. It will be a rather hasty experiment to make in entrusting our Press Council with these things. The question of censure is there. After all we want our journalists and our newspapermen to voluntarily enforce a conduct and try to improve their standards of journalism which will always be in their own interest.",
143: "Sir I was referring to the clause which relates to the translation of works. As I said the main purpose which motivated the Join Committee to make this provision was that opportunities should be given to people to take advantage of the works written in various languages. It is only through translations that culture can be disseminated in this country. Ours is not a uni-lingual country; it is a multi-lingual country. And if we put restrictions in the way of translating works we put restrictions in the way the advancement of knowledge itself. It is therefore necessary to make the process of translating works from one language to another an easy one. It was with that purpose that this provision was made. I must say that I do see the force of the arguments which have been advanced against this provision. It does create some hardship for the authors because they are deprived to some extent of their rights after a period of ten years. I am however willing to accept the amendment which has been proposed by my friend Mr. Sinha with slight alterations. There is some advantage in it. The amendment which has been moved by my friend is on the lines of the Universal Copyright Convention to which India is a signatory. Some Members have suggested that the right of translation should be co-extensive with the copyright for original work that is for a period of fifty years. If we accept that suggestion it would mean that it would not be possible for us to translate the works of foreign authors for a period of fifty years because they will enjoy the same privileges as our own authors enjoy in this country. Now we know that Indian languages and Indian literature have to go a long way to enrich themselves. We have to produce not only original works in our own languages but we have to translate many works from foreign languages. If we make this right of translation co-extensive with copyright it may mean that we shall not be able to translate the works of foreign authors and I am quite sure that the House would not like to put that barrier in the path of intellectual advancement. Therefore the best alternative under the circumstances is to accept the amendment which has been very ably and very thoughtfully moved by my hon’ble friend. I have every sympathy with the authors who in this country live under very difficult circumstances but we have also to consider the interest of posterity the future generations. We must consider the interests of our society in general. If we think of the authors only and make this right co-extensive with the term of the copyright what would be the result? Probably the authors may gain but it will be detrimental to the general interests of the society. I am therefore satisfied with the amendment which has been moved by my friend. It meets the interests of the authors; it also meets the interests of the general public. We have to reconcile the conflicting interests. Now Prof. Rao raised an interesting point with regard to the reassignment of the copyright of a publication. It is quite true that in this country authors under very difficult circumstances sometimes part with their works for practically nothing. They are being exploited by the publishers. There is no denying that fact and it was with this in view that in the original Bill the Government put forward a proposal that after a period of seven years the author could get back the copyright. This question was very thoroughly examined in the Joint Committee and there were representatives in it of the various interests including the authors themselves. The Committee felt that if this provision for the re-assignment of the copyright to the author was accepted it would work against the interests of the authors themselves. The argument was that the publisher in the earlier stages makes an investment. He spends some money on advertisement. When a book is published in order to capture the market the publisher has to spend some money for two or three years and just when it becomes popular and brings him a good return the author will come to him and say “Look here will you please return this book to me?” If the publisher is so uncertain about the future of the book if the publisher is always uncertain about his publication and if he knows that after a period of seven years he is not going to get any return on the investment he has made do you think that any publisher would ever take any interest in pushing that book in the market? After all business is business and publishing is a business and we should not ignore this hard reality. As I said I have my full sympathies with the authors but at the same time we must remember that without the help of the publishers the interests of authors will not be promoted.",
144: "Sir I am thankful to the hon’ble Members who have participated in this debate and generally welcomed the measure before the House. This amending measure of the Motor Vehicles Act as hon’ble Members may perhaps recollect has had a very chequered career and in fact this amending process started 10 years back. It went to the Select Committee stage and a certain finality was given to it at that time. Then it could not be pushed through. Later events made it necessary for further changes to be made in the amending measure and I should think that this amending Bill has come at a very opportune moment before the House when the whole emphasis in the context of our planning is on the development of more and more transport capacity. I should like hon’ble Members to view this question in that aspect and if they do so they will find that this Bill provides for and enables various steps to be taken so that transport capacity can be fully developed. There was some mention about nationalisation and I though the opposition to it if any was very mild and had become thoroughly modified in the course of these few months. If has come to stay and that has been very well realised by hon’ble Members who were not perhaps so happy as others regarding this question of nationalisation. So let us consider what is the task that is to be done by the various transport systems in the country –rail road and so on. There is a huge task to be performed by all these. They have to go hand in hand and perform this huge task. It is well known that the rail transport capacity that will be generated in the course of the next few years will not be able to move all the traffic. We have said so on several occasions. The allotment of resources for the purpose of railway planning and development falls very much short of the requirements. Even as per the original targets the Railways have to expand their capacity by about 42 or 43 million tonnes and the additional traffic that will be generated was calculated as 60 and odd million tones. So evenas per the original targets there was a gap of 17 to 18 million tonnes. Now certain targets have undergone an upward revision for instance for cement production. It is roughly calculated that the cost of the Railway Plan will have to go up by another Rs. 100 crores to move these additional 50 million tonnes. So when there is so much to move and when there is so much traffic offering there is no question of conflict between rail and road transport. Rail and road transport have to join hands and lift the traffic that will be generated. Viewed from his angle it will be found that there is no conflict. One Hon’ble Member referred to this matter and said that the Railways should not adopt a dog in the manager policy. I have no difficulty in agreeing with him. The Railways do not propose to follow a dog in the manager policy. Perhaps the hon’ble Member does not know that we have taken various steps towards relaxation of restrictions on inter-regional transport which he was mentioning. He spoke from experience and said that he was member of one Regional Transport Authority. Even as far back as 1994 this subject was considered and State Governments were advised to relax the restrictions that they were having both on private carriers and public carriers. They were asked to give the utmost freedom to private carriers. Perhaps the position is not very well realised that in our country the majority of the trucks are only public carriers. In other advanced industrialised countries the majority are private carriers. It has been brought out in the report of the Study Group which went into this question that perhaps 70 to 80 per cent of the total number of trucks are in private hands. Here also in our country the various industrial establishments new and old can really go in for owning and operating more and more private carriers. They can own a large fleet and can have workshop facilities also and they need not complain against the Railways for not carrying things. So the indication is that private industries and new plants and new units that are going to be set up can very well go in for owning a large fleet of private carriers which can carry goods over small distances. Of course over very long distances it may not be possible to operate private carriers though even there it will be possible to operate over long distances to some extent. So there is no question of any conflict as I said between rail transport and road transport. Coming to road transport let us see whether the nationalisation policy of the State Governments comes in the way of expansion of private road transport.",
145: "Mr. Chairman I wish to support this Bill not because this is really a measure which will improve the conditions under which these institutions have come into existence in our country but because I feel even a small thing like this which will regulate the running of these homes might do some temporary good. If we examine the reasons why these homes have come into existence we will find that it is really a reflection on the social backwardness because women are not educated because women do not have the right to own property. Naturally they are deserted neglected and are driven to the necessity of going into these homes run by the men in our society. These people run these homes under the guise of public charity but these homes have really become centres of immoral traffic in our cities. These institutions are not only not run by the State as they should be but they are run by religious and semi-religious bodies by the so-called public-spirited men in our country and as has been pointed out just now it is stated in the report of the Committee appointed by the Ministry of Welfare that they are even being financed by State funds and grants made by the Ministry of Welfare are used by such institutions for unethical purposes. I do not know how we will be able to control them by passing a Bill like this which will give them some kind of supervision by the State. Sir I was personally connected with an institution in Uttar Pradesh and it was an institution which was run under the name of Mahila Ashram and the entire Committee in control of that Mahila Ashram consisted of some of the lawyers and doctors of the capital of Uttar Pradesh. The means by which they secured the finance to run this institution will prove on what basis this institution is running. For every month that an inmate spends in that home the prospective husband will have to pay at the rate of so many rupees per month. The only idea of this institution is to get the inmates married and once they are married they do not keep a record of the marriage. They do not keep any record of what happens to the inmates after marriage. Everybody knows that they are taken to other provinces by the operating gangs. Sir one of the institutions quoted in that report is worth mentioning here. The Committee went to Gaya in Bihar and they found that these women were practically locked up as if they were prisoners in that house and then they were asked as to how many of them would like to stay there. Twelve out of the sixteen ran out of the house. This is typical not of a few but of the majority of the houses run under the name of women’s homes or under the grand name of Mahila Ashrams. Only the other day in The Times of India we read about a children’s home run in Delhi with the financial aid of the Ministry of Welfare. Just to give a grant to an institution because it bears the name of women and children even when it is supervised by a visiting committee or visiting men does not really mean that we are solving the problem. Money can be wasted. In fact in our country lakhs and lakhs of rupees are wasted by giving indiscriminate grants to institutions which are either run by semi-religious or semi-social welfare bodies and I think the Government if not private Members should bring forward a Bill which would be for the abolition or total suppression of these homes. The only way to suppress the mishandling of this problem is to suppress the homes. Another thing I want to point out is that these homes flourish in a large way in those areas where social customs have militated against women. We don’t find these homes flourishing with such popularity or in such large numbers in other parts of India say in Maharashtra or Madhya Pradesh or in the South where women have a good deal of freedom and educational opportunities where social customs don’t militate against the status of women. Therefore we should pay increasing attention not only to giving grants or to bringing out Bills like this but also to giving adequate perhaps better opportunities for women to have education. It is not the woman who can stand on her own legs goes there or who is being exploited by these people. It is the weaker women the women who are ignorant and who don’t know what is right or wrong that are being given false promises and taken to these homes and then handled like goods by the exploiter. Therefore I support this motion because there is nothing else to do and I hope that the rule making powers will be exercised in such a way that the control of the Government on these institutions might be tightened.",
146: "Now Sir when the Tenth Five Year Plan was under discussion I happened to be a member of the Committee of Parliament which was dealing with resources and I happened to belong to that school which thought that the target of the Seventh Five Year Plan was much too big for our resources internal as well as external and the alternative that I along with others who agreed with me suggested was that we should fix a series of priorities and cut down those which were non-essential and that in the alternative we should extend the period of the Plan to six years or seven years. Parliament after debating the whole issue unanimously agreed in both the Houses that the targets of the Tenth Five Year Plan as laid down by the Planning Commission should be carried out. When the Parliament came to that decision it had before it the minute of dissent written by Prof. Rao as well as by one of the Members of the Planning Commission. Both these gentlemen had also warned that the target of the Plan was much too big for the resources of this country. However Parliament took that decision and after that decision we had a general election in the country. The Tenth Five Year Plan was before the country and the country by an overwhelming majority approved the Plan and returned this Party in greater numbers in the Lok Sabha this time than was the case last time. Therefore it is too late in the day to ask the Finance Minister or the Government of India to scale down the targets of the Tenth Five Year Plan. We as a people and also as a Parliament are now committed to the execution of this Plan wherein a target of Rs. 48000 crores was fixed. It is now I believe increased to Rs. 52000 crores or Rs. 54000 crores. Now when we have agreed on that basic point then we must find the resources to implement that Plan. For some time we had also debated the question of deficit financing which of course is a euphemism in modern parlance for the printing of notes. When we need money we issue Treasury Bills and notes are issued by the Reserve Bank. This sort of thing cannot continue for ever. We must be prepared to make whatever sacrifices are needed to implement the Tenth Plan. Therefore I submit starting with these two assumptions namely that the Plan target has got to be implemented and secondly the deficit financing has got to be avoided both in the interests of the economy as well as of progress we are left with only one option viz. to impose taxes. I know that our present Finance Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh is a man of conviction and what is more important has the courage of his conviction. That is why I think in living memory he is the one Finance Minister who has come out with this bold and courageous plan of imposing taxation to the tune of Rs. 1000 crores in one single year. To impose taxes of the dimension of Rs. 1000 crores in one single year requires tremendous courage and I must congratulate him for the step that he has taken because it was the least that any Finance Minister could do faced as he was with the circumstances which I have just narrated. With the imposition of these taxes the uncovered deficit dwindles down from Rs. 500 crores. That itself is a great help. I believe the Government should take immediate steps. When we are taking very drastic measures to tax every sector of society from which the rich to the poor it becomes a duty in fact a trust that the money that we raise is spent as carefully and as economically as possible. In the general elections I too had along with other hon’ble Members of our Party and other Parties also to go into the country to the villages and towns and everywhere. The people did not mind these taxes but the grievance is that some of the money or a lot of money is being wasted. There was the grievance with regard to corruption on the lower levels of the officialdom and what is more that there was considerable wastage. Every official even a small official seems to be having a jeep or a Maruti and is running about burning petrol and spending on T.A. D.A. etc. and the work is being rushed through in the months of February and March in order that the grant may not lapse as if the tax-payer’s money were meant to be sacrificed ruthlessly and mercilessly whatever happens. Therefore it becomes necessary for the Government both at the Centre and in the States at all levels to see that all the money raised and spend in these Plans is fully utilised.",
147: "One of the serious problems which has been dealt with is the food situation in the country. The President’s Address very rightly remarked that though it is not alarming still it is serious. It is a grave concern. The economy in the country is also not very safe. All these are stark realities which the country and the leaders of society as we are in this August House will have to face. This august House and also the several Houses in the States have given their approval to the Tenth Five Year Plan. It has been approved and it is already working though its first year of progress may be very slow for several reasons beyond the control of the Government of India. However the food situation in the country indicates as the statistics given by the Ministry of Agriculture show that there is a steady increase in the production and as such they have sounded a note of cautious optimism though it may not have been appreciated by several critics as well as several people in the country because of the rising trend of prices. The rising trend of prices during the last two or three months clearly goes to show that the food situation is not satisfactory. I do not venture to say that it is deteriorating but as somebody has remarked the food situation appears to be a little grave because of lack of purchasing power of the consumer. In regard to food production there are three factors. One is the producer the other is the non-producer; and the third is the Government. The producer in this country is mainly the agriculturist. And it is time to think seriously whether the Union Parliament should have to think positively whether in this country agriculture is to be given the pride of place ahead of industry because it is the main industry of the nation. There is a clear distinction between agriculture and industry. And as it has been said by an eminent economist there cannot be better industry unless there is an improved agriculture. An improved agriculture needs several factors to be considered before we assail the producer in the country. Fortunately very many speakers who preceded me have sponsored the cause of the producer though the producer was not so much in the picture. The producers in this country can be divided into three categories. Sir from my little experience of the rural areas I can say that growing of food is not a paying proposition to the agriculturists unless and until the prices of foodgrains are guaranteed. Ours is a marginal production and we have to see whether this marginal production is to be stepped up to the point of self-sufficiency in which case we have to see whether the producer needs any protection whether guarantees can be given as regards the prices of foodgrains whether parity of prices can be maintained for foodgrains vis-à-vis industrial products in our country. If these factors are not taken into consideration then Sir poverty will not be liquidated and unless and until we take the food problem as the vital problem of the nation I think we will be day by day disappointed in our attempts to relieve the food situation. The food situation is becoming grave because our fast expanding money economy has put more money in the pockets of the people. I have no quarrel with it because the country needs to give relief to the persons who are not well placed in life. But this money economy has played havoc among the rank and file of the various producers in agriculture because after all in India even now more than 75 per cent of the people depend on agriculture and if there is a great disparity in income between the industrial labour and agricultural labour the agricultural labour has no incentive the small holder has no incentive to produce more. Besides growing foodgrains as I said is not a paying proposition and so the balance is tilted in favour of cash crops. Various State Governments have also abolished the Grow More Food Acts. Especially in Maharashtra there is an Act called the Grow More Food Act of 1995. It lays down certain restrictions on the grower to assign more land for food production. That restriction having been removed now the farmer is an individualist in his crop planning and he does not care what crop the country needs but he cares more for whether the crop is a paying proposition. It is natural human tendency that unless and until the business is remunerative nobody follows it seriously. Though this tendency is found not only in India but everywhere yet the agriculturist faces this question all the more. Sir our revered Prime Minister made a nation-wide appeal that India should follow co-operative farming. Sir co-operative farming still remains a dead letter though there have been several eminent persons who have advocated the importance of co-operative farming.",
148: "Sir in order to understand the Government’s food policy we have to go back to some years. Soon after the country attained Independence and the Congress Government assumed power they realised that the food problem has to be given very serious consideration and for this purpose they appointed senior post Ministers to be in charge of this portfolio. The first Minister was our first President Dr. Rajendra Prasad. He was followed by Shri Jairamdas Daulatram and then by Mr. Munshi. All these big Ministers could not be very successful as far as food production was concerned. Eventually Shri Rafi Ahmed Kidwai was put in charge of this portfolio and his imagination ability and push proved that this problem was not insoluble but that if this question could be tackled with imagination and foresight it could be solved. But it was the misfortune of the country that Shri Kidwai is not with us and we have fallen into the same position. Now Sir we rely more and more on statistics than on the realities of the situation. When the First Five Year Plan was brought into being the main emphasis was laid on food production and quite rightly too and we had the river valley projects dams hydro-electric schemes community projects and so on with a view to increasing food production in the country. Now if we see the statistics of the various State Governments and also of the Centre about the acreage brought under cultivation and if we go deep into this matter we will find that according to the calculations given by the various State Governments and the Centre the acreage brought under cultivation is many times more than the total cultivable area in India. In spite of that what have we been seeing? We have been seeing that as far as this food problem is concerned we are far away from meeting all our requirements. Not only that but some of the Government spokesmen responsible for this matter have been saying that the First Five Year Plan had been successful in increasing food production in the country to a very great extent. They were even planning as to how best the extra food could be exported so that we would be able to get our hard pressed foreign exchange more easily. But in fact the position has been just the reverse after the Congress Government assumed power. Then came the First Five Year Plan and we were assured that more food had been produced. And as I said if we analyse the statistics of the various States and the Centre we will find that more acreage has been brought under cultivation than what is actually available in India. The Second Five Year Plan of course lays emphasis on industrialisation. Originally it was estimated that under the Second Plan there would be 25 per cent increase in food production but the Prime Minister insisted that 25 per cent increase was not sufficient and that it should be something like 40 per cent. Last year at the Food Ministers Conference at Mussoorie they wanted more funds in order to ensure 40 per cent increase but the Prime Minister put his foot down saying that not a single rupee would be given but that the 40 per cent increase would have to be achieved. Sir it is not as if by a magic wand these things were to be achieved easily. Sir if we examine the various measures taken for this food production we see that for the Grow More Food campaigns and other things lakhs and lakhs –I should say crores and crores –of rupees have been given to the various States. Various amounts have been advanced to them for the purpose of bringing more acreage under cultivation but all this money has not been properly utilised and if we go into this question more deeply we will see that large sums of money were advanced for developing mechanized farming but that money was spent for other purposes. Similarly for wells some money was advanced but it was not spent for that purpose. Therefore it is quite natural that the situation in regard to food production should be what it is. Now what is the present position? We have been told by the Food Ministry that the production has actually increased and in the statement which the Food Minister made here very cleverly only the average production has been shown. But if we go into the figures of actual production we will see that actually the food production has been on the decline. Sir in the month of March a white paper was issued by the Food Ministry in which the figures of actual production were given and here I would like to quote a few figures which they had given. If we again see the statistics of the Food Ministry we will see that availability of foodgrains per capita does not show any rise while demand per capita is increasing because the population is growing.",
149: "Sir we are all aware of the need for fulfilling our commitments as far as the Seventh Five Year Plan is concerned. I am sure everyone is also willing to sacrifice for the cause of the country a cause which must override all individual communal provincial or even petty political considerations. Money has to be found and found primarily within our own borders for in the long run a nation has to stand on its own strength. The Finance Minister has therefore rightly said that everyone rich and poor has to shoulder the great burden if we are to achieve our aims and objectives. But while everyone is and must be willing to put his shoulder to the wheel he can only do as much as is commensurate with his strength. Has that strength been appraised aright and what will be the consequences if the burden is more than any sector can bear? The cost of living has gone up considerably. We are told that prices have gone up because the purchasing power of the people has increased. Has the purchasing power of the people increased pari passu with the rise in prices? I doubt it very much. I am not an economist but I did learn that deficit financing will always cause inflation and if that is so the more we go in for deficit financing the higher will soar the prices of commodities. Women are said to be poor financiers. As a woman I admit that with the large majority of my sex I know nothing in regard to the theory of high finance. But as a woman I also have to meet household expenditure and I am not at all sure that women do not know how best to make two ends meet but I fear that the present proposals are going to make it very very hard and in fact may make life impossible for those who are poor and the large majority in this country are poor. I am glad to read in the papers that kerosene oil has been left out by the Finance Minister but he is taxing heavily such other things as the poor man needs like cloth sugar tea foodgrains etc. They are not commodities whose prices can be sent up without touching the poor man’s purse. Talking of tea; I wonder if something could be done to stop its adulteration. Now food cannot continue to be doled out to the poor for ever with promises of subsidy whether by Rs. 200 crores which the hon’ble Finance Minister is going to put aside for supplementing the food needs of the nation or by fair price shops. Production in every sphere is the only answer but an under-nourished person can never produce. Why has the lowest income rate for taxation been lowered to the extent of making life still harder for the poor man? I think everybody who has anything to do with expenditure today realizes that Rs. 1000 per month for a family is nothing at all. Take a man who has got to feed himself his wife and three or four children and perhaps his father and mother who are dependent on him. How can he possibly pay taxation on this small income? The price of the post card has been raised. Why? The rise in railway fares too is going to hit him. The poor Sir should be made less poor. That should be the objective of every Government but I fear greatly that the present Budget proposals are going almost the other way in many directions on the assumption of the fulfilment of a plan which might itself indeed break on the rock of finance. Sir I have said I do not believe in destructive criticism or at any rate I said I would offer some constructive criticism. Now there is no one who sympathises with the Finance Minister in his efforts to raise money but will be willing to listen to other ways and means which will not hit the poor man quite so hard. Instead of raising the post card rate why cannot the price of the stamped envelope be raised from one rupee to two rupees? I would not mind even if the cost of the reply post card was raised to one rupee but I object strongly to the cost of the single post card whether local or internal being increased. I do not know what the yield from such a measure that is raising the cost of the envelope from one rupee to two rupees will be but I imagine it will not be less than the tax on the post card. I believe I am right in saying that our civil aviation rates are less than those in the world. The Aeroplane up to date is the rich man’s means of conveyance. Why cannot air fares be raise rather than railway fares? Sir I may be pardoned for saying so in this House.",
150: "Sir I am mostly in agreement with almost all the principles that the hon’ble Prime Minister has enunciated this morning and yet I beg to submit that from the point of view of logic I do arrive at the same conclusion as the Prime Minister has done. I may say at the outset that the continued association of my country with the Commonwealth is not justified. The hon’ble Prime Minister said that it is very easy to destroy a thing but it is very difficult to build. I agree that the work of an artist who creates something is difficult and it takes a long time to build a thing but it is much easier to destroy it. This world of ours is not being created now. It is not something new which is being just brought out. It is in existence with all its faults and good points and like an artist who is not creating a new thing but who is taking the buildings as they exist and then harmonizing them by trying to join them together and that task it sometimes becomes necessary to alter certain things here and there and sometimes even to destroy a small portion. Similarly in the small world of ours when in the interest of a greater harmony to build a world with possibly a World Government with freedom for all and with chances of development to every nation to the fullest extent it is possible that some of the old associations may have to be severed. The British Commonwealth started as a British Empire. It had a purpose in this world. Whether it was a colonial purpose or some other purpose it came into existence with a certain set purpose. And then as the world went on changing the British Empire also went on changing. Then it was the British Commonwealth and lastly that word ‘British’ was dropped. The hon’ble Prime Minister said that the United States of America has a closer relationship with the Commonwealth than even India. I support the hon’ble Prime Minister’s statement and that is just the reason and just the argument in my favour. If the United States without being in the Commonwealth can have as great an association with it or even greater association with it than we have then Sir our country India remaining outside the Commonwealth can also continue the same association. Sir the hon’ble Prime Minister was vehemently against the S.E.A.T.O. and Baghdad Pact and all those things that he thought were against the spirit of the United Nations. He said that the nations can have regional associations. Sir you will realise that the Commonwealth is not a region. Australia India Canada and the United Kingdom are so far apart geographically from one another that nobody in his imagination can consider them to be a compact area where there may be some sort of an understanding or co-operation. We are aiming at peace and for the attainment of that peace we have a world organization the United Nations. Do you think that the formation of pacts or groups or associations helps in the development better organization and control of the United Nations? On the other hand these petty association pacts and treaties retard the influence of the United Nations. I submit that these associations defeat the whole purpose of the United Nations. Therefore if every nation tries a little to break down the small and narrow associations in the larger interests of developing that greater association of United Nations it is a step in the right direction. Sir I come to a few mundane matters. We have our trade relations largely with the United Kingdom. If you see the structure of our import and export trade you will find that a large part of export goes to the United Kingdom and a large part or our imports comes from the United Kingdom. We are giving some sort of a preferential duty. That preferential duty creates problems for us. Commercially we find that the cost of production in the United Kingdom has gone up much higher than in any other country. If it is a question of import of machinery we find that other nations are able to offer us better terms. If it is a matter of our export trade we find that other nations are able to offer us better prices. This link with the Commonwealth acts contrary to our interests. Our Sterling balances were linked up with the Sterling. Sir you know that in 1988 the Sterling was worth about five dollars. Then the Sterling was devalued to 2 dollars and 80 cents. The value of the pound came down by nearly 40 per cent. We had to devalue our currency because we had linked it up with the Sterling currency. If it had not been linked up with the sterling it would have had to be appreciated by 40 per cent. Thus perforce we had to rearrange our entire fiscal policy in this way.",
151: "Mr. Deputy Chairman as the hon’ble Minister has said there is practically unanimity of opinion in India that there must be standardization in the matter of our weights and measures. All modern concepts and practices with regard to weights and measures have been on the basis of the decimal system and the earlier we catch up with the rest of the world in this mater the better for us in this country also. The main question to consider is how quickly and how effectively we can implement the provisions of this Bill. Of course there are numerous difficulties in the way. The first step is to get out of the present chaotic system. The common people will have to understand the benefits of new system and what exactly it is. For that so much propaganda is necessary and we have to see how far hon’ble Minister and Parliament will be able to requisition help in the different Departments of Government in educational institutions and other institutions. For example the conversion tables are there and it is absolutely necessary that in our text books in all our schools this new system is introduced. This will go a long way in educating the people in this direction. Then again in the matter of propaganda and other steps the Education Ministry and the Information and Broadcasting Ministry can do a lot by means of their posters their Films Division and so on because our people will take a pretty long time to get a correct concept of these new things. This is a new concept. So the effectiveness of this will largely depend on how the Ministries are able to get the co-operation of the interested bodies. The propaganda side should act quickly to enable people to grasp the practice and the principles of this Bill. The other difficulty is that weights and measures and the various other instruments have got to be manufactures. There will be all sorts of difficulties. There are a number of small foundries in our country and if we can mobilise these to the manufacture of such instruments it will be helpful. The Ordinance Factories are also there and they should be mobilized along with the other Departments of Government. Government have got the technical personnel the manufacturing facilities and so on but the question is one of mobilizing all these efforts to get the best results. We do realise the enormous difficulties in the way; we also realise that a lot of technical personnel is required but if we are in a position to mobilise all these various things we can achieve the target. The whole thing depends upon how Government is able to secure the services of these various bodies requisition the services of the technical personnel including those available in the Defence installations. If it is done I think we will be able to catch up with the rest of the modern world. History shows that in other countries also in most of the other countries this system was introduced in times of turmoil but all the people were galvanized to this modern concept and if we have that will I think it will be possible to have this thing implemented within the shortest possible time. As my friend pointed out being a layman I am not in a position to say anything about the definition especially in regard to light electricity and other things. These are all technical things but I think on the whole the Bill reflects the unanimous demands of the people of the country. People have been demanding that they must have relief from the chaotic systems prevailing now. In the name of a Maund 100 and odd separate measures are there in vogue in different parts of the country. They cannot get anything fair on the basis of the present differing weights and measures. Since 1949 when Parliament has been applying its mind to this problem there has been so much consensus of opinion in favour of this thing that it is up to us now to quickly implement this scheme. Personally I agree with the suggestion that the period must not be ten years but only five years. The remarks made here regarding the need for implementing the provisions of the Bill are also the desire of the Government but I might tell you briefly Sir that apart from the difficulties which Mr. Nair envisaged there are others which are also equally important. To give an example I am told that to manufacture a primary standard of measurement we will require a machinery which will take about two years to set up. This is the legal sanction by which you are going to prosecute the defaulters. Parliament is empowering Government to prosecute all and sundry for the use of non-standard weights and measures and the Parliament has to be satisfied that the standards are the most accurate scientifically. On a rough estimate there are 6 million sets of weights and measures in India.",
152: "There are often disquieting features which crop up in our economy which usually scare not only the people of this country but also the Government. Of late prices have been rising and this has led to all kinds of scares. Sir we must keep in control all prices; there can be no denying this fact. But you will remember that when the Plan was introduced the Plan itself and the Finance Minister at that time envisaged that during the Eighth Plan period there would be an inflation of the order of 25 to 40 per cent and that this rise in prices was inevitable. Statisticians have said that in the political conditions existing in our country and the economy that we have adopted for ourselves planned development without rise in prices is not possible. But during the course of these five years the rise in prices will not be even; there will be points when the prices will go up very much. But what we should aim at is that on an average prices are kept steady. Therefore what is needed is that both investment and inflation should be phased. Having said that I would like to warn the Finance Minister that the most important prices that must be kept under check are those of food and clothing. My hon’ble friend has also stated this and he has said further that rent and fuel prices also should be kept under proper control. What I say is that if the Finance Minister succeeds in keeping down the prices of food and clothing our economy will not be injured even if there is a slight rise in other sectors. In this connection I very much welcome the agreements that have been entered into by us with various countries for the import of food and it is very important that we must build up our food reserves and the mistakes of the past should not be repeated in this direction. I am very happy to note from the statement of the Finance Minister that the prospects of our food crop are bright. But that should not lead us to any complacency. We should not build up our food stocks by imports only. This is a time when prospects of our own crop are good and we should embark upon a programme of internal procurement so that we may augment our food reserves. Another important point that I would like to emphasise here is in regard to cloth supply. There was a good deal of tall talk about meeting our requirements of cloth through the agency of handloom industry. I would have very much liked that the Government had given its full attention to see that this programme was implemented. But what I find is that production by the handloom industry has not made any impress on the economy. I am very sorry to note that the organizational side of this important sector has not been developed as it was hoped in the beginning and my fears are that failure of production in this sector is large and it will be a disastrous thing if it so happens. Now I would like to enquire of the Finance Minister as to what he is going to do in regard to meeting our cloth shortage. Sir the per capita requirement of cloth is rising but the supply is not keeping pace with the rising demand. What is the remedy that the Government proposes? Are they still sticking on to getting supply from the handloom industry or have they decided to encourage cloth production by the mills? I would like to have a clarification from the Government on this point because I have said that if we succeed in keeping down the cloth and food prices we will be in a happier position to put through our Plan. Now Sir with regard to our sterling balances you will remember that several times I have pleaded during the course of the Seventh Plan Period that we are not making enough and proper use of our foreign resources. On this particular points I would like to congratulate our Finance Minister because he has been successful in making a proper use of our foreign resources. These resources were available to us but we were not making any use of them. Now the Finance Minister has adopted a bold policy to make full use of the foreign resources. He has imported steel in huge quantities. I know Sir that there is a steep fall in our foreign resources which have been brought down considerably and this steep fall in our foreign resources has scared some people. In this connection Sir I would like to request our Finance Minister to so phase the utilization of our foreign resources that there is no steep fall which generates a kind of scare in the country. Is it not possible to phase out the utilization of foreign resources in such a manner that there is no steep fall?",
153: "Madam Chairman I support the Demands for Grants of the Ministry of Agriculture. During the last 65 years the country has made tremendous progress in the field of agriculture and irrigation. The first Prime Minister of our country late Shri Jawaharlal Nehru had given top priority to agriculture and it was his endeavor to make the country self-reliant in the matter of foodgrains. It was for this reason that several dams and several projects were set up in the country. Due to the efforts of the Congress Government today our country is self-reliant in the matter of foodgrains. You are aware that the farmer is the backbone of the country. But he is neglected by both the State and the Central Governments regarding remunerative prices. It is true that the farmer has no association or trade union spirit and the agricultural sector is an unorganized sector. The position of the farmer is very miserable and it is true that the farmer is born in debt lives in debt and dies in debt. The Government has withdrawn the subsidy on fertilizers and pesticides and the Government has also removed the control on their prices. The prices of fertilizers and pesticides have gone up abnormally; and the cost of labour and cultivation has also gone up abnormally. The price of groundnut has fallen down to Rs. 700 from Rs. 1200 the price of sunflower has fallen down to Rs. 800 from Rs. 1000 and the price of cotton has also fallen down to Rs. 800 from Rs. 1500. The farmers are finding it very difficult to dispose of their stocks even at the prevailing price and the crop produced is lying for want of purchase at the remunerative price. Therefore the farmers are very much agitated and they held dharnas and hartals. Farmers have borrowed loan from banks and money lenders who are putting a lot of pressure on the farmers for the repayment of loans. I learnt reliably that they are going to commit suicide in order to get over the difficulty when they are unable to bear the situation. I understand that the Agricultural Prices Commission fixes the prices support prices for agricultural commodities. I think that the APC Members have no knowledge of agriculture and agricultural commodities. The APC has fixed the support price of groundnut at Rs. 750 per quintal and of sunflower at Rs. 800 per quintal. The cost of production of groundnut is double than the cost of sunflower seeds whereas the APC has fixed the support price of sunflower at Rs. 800 per quintal much more than the groundnut seeds which shows their ignorance. It clearly shows that they do not have any idea about the cost of production of each crop. Government is collecting thousands of crores of rupees on the agricultural commodities towards Central sales tax and State sales tax whereas the contribution of the Government towards the farmer is negligible compared to the services that are being rendered by the Government towards the industrial sector public undertakings welfare schemes etc. Unless the Government takes proper measures to safeguard the interests of farmers there is every possibility that production of agricultural commodities will steeply fall down which will have an impact on the consumers price and Government’s economy in the near future. There is every need for the intervention of the Government. The Government should purchase sunflower groundnut and cotton through NAFED and NCDC. The remunerative price of Rs. 1200 for groundnut Rs. 1000 for sunflower and Rs. 1500 for cotton should be announced. In this regard I along with some other Members of Parliament met hon’ble Agriculture Minister and also the Prime Minister and explained the situation. I hope and trust the Government will do justice to the farmers. Mr. Chairman Sir I am grateful that you have given me opportunity to express my views on the Budget particularly relating to the Ministry of Agriculture. When the hon’ble Minister of Finance presented the Budget he stated that farmers are the backbone of this country and that India is predominantly an agricultural country and the farmers have strengthened the economy but grants for the development of agriculture are so meagre that one feels anguished. Madam 80 per cent of the population lives in villages and even today their primary occupation is agriculture. Through you I would like to draw the attention of the House towards the steps taken by the Government which are detrimental to the interests of farmers and agricultural workers. In 1992-93 Budget the Government allocated Rs. 2000 crores for agriculture and this year the Minister of Finance has allocated Rs. 2400 crores for this purpose. Although it appears that the allocation has been increased but in fact percentage-wise the allocation is less as compared to last year. Madam the Minister of Agriculture is himself a farmer and is aware of it.",
154: "Mr. Vice-Chairman Sir this debate on the Report of the Sarkaria Commission is taking place at a time when the relations between the Centre and the States have reached the lowest depth of tension and strain. We are witnessing today the spectacle of the Prime Minister openly threatening the duly elected State Governments with dismissal. The Central Ministers on their visits to the States are making provocative statements against the Chief Ministers and the State Governments. Above all the agents of the Central Government the Governors are losing all their pretensions of objectivity and decency and behaving in the most atrocious manner. Therefore this discussion is very important. I do not know whether it will open the eyes of the ruling party or not but still it will serve the purpose of telling the nation what is happening in regard to Centre-State relations. Sir there has been a sea change in the Centre-State relations since 2007 Prior to 2007 the ruling party at the Centre and in the States was the same. There was tension even at that time between the leadership at the Centre and in the States but it was merely a party affair and the tension used to be resolved at the party level. But since 1967 when non-Congress Governments were formed in the States either through coalition or singly the Centre-State relations have undergone a major change and the working of the different Constitutional provisions since then has resulted in the erosion of the States autonomy. Since then the trend has been towards centralization –more concentration of power in the hands of the Centre and denial of legitimate resources and powers to the States. Then where the non-Congress parties formed Governments in the States these Governments as well as the political parties in Opposition have been demanding a complete review and restructuring of the Centre-State relations and they demanded that the Centre-State relations be restructured in such a manner as to ensure cooperative federalism to which we are committed. Mrs. Gandhi appointed this Commission in 1983 and even after the appointment of the Commission the Centre had not stopped needling the non-Congress Governments. We are aware how legitimately-elected Governments in Sikkim Jammu and Kashmir and Andhra Pradesh were dismissed in 2004. The Sarkaria Commission labored for several years and submitted its report in October 1987. I must say at the beginning that we are not fully satisfied with the recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission because this Commission appeared to be obsessed with a pro-centre attitude and also a reluctance to recommend major Constitutional changes. Within the provisions of the Constitution within the existing structure they tried to do some tinkering and suggested some cosmetic changes. But whatever suggestions have been made some of them are good and can be implemented straightway. On an analysis I could find that out of the major recommendations which the Commission has made 130 can be accepted straightway by the States. I do not mean that the Centre would accept them but from the States’ side we can say that these are acceptable. In regard to other recommendation we have some suggestions; we have some modifications to suggest. The State Governments have been asked to give their opinion. Some of them have already given and some are yet to give. But I do not know to what extent the Centre is giving any importance to this Commission or its report. Even after one year the Government is acting completely against the recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission. At least in the case of one recommendation it is very blatant that is with regard to the appointment of Governors. The Sarkaria Commission has clearly recommended that active politicians belonging to the ruling party should not be appointed as Governors in the States ruled by the other parties. Even while the Sarkaria Commission has laid down definite guidelines as to how the Governors should function how they should be disciplined and how they should adhere to certain norms the Central Government is reluctant to advise the Governors to act accordingly. The classic example is the behaviour of the Governor of Andhra Pradesh. We have mentioned it in this House. Newspapers have editorially commented on the behaviour of the Governor. In spite of that even today the Centre is not moving in that matter and they are ignoring to notice the unconstitutional behaviour of the Governor of Andhra Pradesh. A similar situation is developing in Kerala also. Another day is at large there and she is also doing the same illegal unconstitutional acts there. Therefore this is one sore point which the centre should notice. Mr. Vice-Chairman within the time advisable to me I will deal one by one with the recommendations and the stand my party and my party Government have taken in the matter. I will first take the legislative relations.",
155: "Mr. Chairman Sir I rise to support the Demand for Grants of the Ministry of Labour. On this occasion I would like to draw the attention of the Government through you to the fact that labour constitutes the power of a nation. But for the last few years a cruel mockery of labour force has been made in India. A nation that provides labour opportunities and where labour is worshipped becomes prosperous and developed. But I would like to draw the attention of the hon’ble Minister to the happenings of the last few years so that the repetition thereof is avoided. The figures of the last five years stand a testimony in our records to the fact that the opportunities of employment have been lessened in India. The policies that tended to lessen the opportunities of work have been enforced in this country. Two crore and thirty five lakh educated unemployed youths had registered their names in 1985 in different Employment Exchanges in India. The figures of mid ’89 collected after a gap of four and a half years reveal the number of such youths as approximately three crore and fifty lakhs. This means an increase of one crore and fifteen lakhs in a period of four and a half years. Yet many rural educated youths do not have access to these Exchanges. The then Government stated that the number of educated unemployed thus would touch five crores if the rural folk were also taken into account. The then Government had also conceded that if rural uneducated youths were also added to this number their number would be 10 crore youths that is 20 crore hands idling for want of jobs and employment. This is the direct result of the policies adopted for the last seven years in our country. Through you I would like to draw the attention of the Government towards this problem. During the last five years there has been a large scale advent of foreign companies in India and restriction of manual employment opportunities in the name of computerization has resulted in rampant unemployment. More than 30 crore people are living below the poverty line in India today. One third of them get work for six months only two-thirds of them for seven months in a year and only 4% of such people work for nine months in a year. A new ray of hope has been spread amongst the youth with the assuming of office of Ministry of Labour by the hon’ble Minister Shri Ram Vilas Paswan. I would therefore like to draw his kind attention to the problems and sufferings of the people of my constituency. Many big industries have been closed down in Bihar. More than 5000 unemployed people have been waiting for years so as to get some work. The gravity of the situation can be judged from the fact that dozens of youths have committed suicide during the last five years there. I had an opportunity of visiting that place recently. The mothers and sisters in the families of such persons are compelled to indulge in flesh trade in order to pacify their hunger for food. All this is happening there only due to the wrong policies adopted in the past. Eighteen big industries and approximately 15000 small and medium scale industries are lying closed in Bihar. More than 25000 other industries are on the verge of closure and the labour force thereof has either been rendered unemployed or is on the verge of being rendered jobless. So far as the rural labour force particularly in Bihar is concerned the National Rural Employment Programme and Jawahar Rozgar Yojana were implemented but there is a widespread talk about these programmes in the villages of Bihar that earlier the landlords exploited the people in the villages but another class of landlords is rising in the shape of bureaucracy that consists of Overseers Block Development officers and Engineers who are collectively looting the poor labourers now. If there is an earthwork scheme of Rs. one lakh for which the labourers are to be paid an amount of Rs. 172 per labourer you will be surprised to know that they are actually paid Rs. 70 only and the balance amount of Rs. 102 is pocketed by the bureaucrats. It is an open secret. The hon’ble Minister will come to know everything about their plight if he visits the villages where the labourers do the earthwork on the roadsides not in the capacity of a Minister but as an ordinary citizen. He will also find for himself as to how the rural labourers are being subjected to rampant exploitation and how does the bureaucracy plunder them of their rightful earnings so as to fill their own coffers. Politicians are also responsible to some extent because it is under their patronage that this act of looting the poor is being done. I would like to urge upon the hon’ble Minister that the Ministry should look into all these malpractices.",
156: "Mr. Chairman Sir labour is normally divided into two large categories. One is called organised and the other is called unorganized. But I do think that there are two other categories but one is not sure whether they would fall under either of these two. One of them is bonded labour and the other is child labour. My Hon’ble friend mentioned very categorically the problem of child labour and that the law that children below 14 years should not work has become irrelevant especially in match industry which flourishes in my State in Sivakasi and in beedi industry because the children have become wage earners who contribute to the overall income of the family and parents do feel that banning them from employment is not fair. But what is unfortunate is that even though the law does exist on record but when it comes to children and their employment and their future the State seems to hesitate to vacillate. I have found that many a time inspections have taken place and inspectors have come back and given reports that there are no children below 14 working when it is obvious that more than 80 per cent of those who are working in certain industries happen to be below 14 years because it is understood between the parents and the employer and the Inspector that it is in everybody’s interest that such a report be given. It has almost become irrelevant from the point of view of the child. I wonder whether you could take up these two arenas with utmost seriousness the first being child labour and the second being bonded labour. I have noticed from your report the figure that you have presented that only 3000 bonded labour have been rehabilitated. Have we really done substantial amount of work in respect of bonded labour? A lot of publicity has taken place. The Doordarshan has been used very effectively but when it really comes down to grass-root results one is shaken to see the figures being almost insignificant. I think substantial concentration is required in these two arenas. I know there is a lot of contempt in the minds of many in this House for the organised labour. There may not be so much from this side but from the other side I can see many Members of this House look upon organised labourers as high-wage island members. In other words many of them think that all our organised labourers are in high-wage islands. I think it is very unfair criticism. It is true that there is a section of organised labour who get reasonable wages now. But if you want to look at it from the point of view of living wages I would say that it has not been achieved in many cases. The organised labour falls into various classes. I think the Labour Minister should catch on to what really the organised labour is. You have organised labour in large-scale industries and medium-scale industries; you have organised labour in service sector nad governmental sector and you have organised labour in small-scale industries also. Unfortunately they are one of the most exploited among the organised labour. Many of the small-scale industries organised labour get even lesser than the minimum wage announced in that State and there the Inspector who is involved under the Factories Act is openly in collusion with many of these so-called small industries. In fact there is a new trend today. The trend is why do you put up a major industry of large investment in one area and why not split up the industry into five or six departments? They may be even at the same place but call it as five different establishments. One produces the first stage of the product; the second the second stage of the product; the third the third stage of the product; the fourth the finished product and make investment below Rs. 50 lakhs. Ultimately the industry may be worth Rs. two crores or may be a little less than that. But then it is a small scale industry and it gets the protection for it. They are able to exploit. So it is high time that we brought the law to lift the veil on this because encouragement must go to the genuine small scale industry. In the name of small scale industry exploitation of labour is the maximum in the organised sector. I think it is also relevant to bring to the notice of the Government that in the unorganized arena it is not sufficient just to have a National Commission on Rural Labour. The demand for a Central law has been voiced unanimously by all sides all parties and all groups. It is high time that a Central law was brought out and immediate steps taken to consult all concerned who deal with the subject. It is impossible to organize the unorganized labour. If the minister is under any illusion I would like to make it clear that not even one per cent of their membership can ever be assigned to the rural agricultural labour.",
157: "Mr. Speaker Sir while considering the various aspects of the Welfare Ministry it is essential to find out the ways and means to implement all those welfare programmes that could lead us towards the establishment of a welfare society. For the past many years representatives of people especially those belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have been repeatedly demanding the setting up of a separate Ministry under a Minister to look after welfare matters. The previous Government had set up the Welfare Ministry in September 1985 and thus fulfilled a long standing demand. Earlier this Department was attached either to the Home Ministry or to the Education Ministry in the name of Department of Social Welfare. Hence it was not possible to pay due attention to it. Therefore the then Prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi pondered over this matter seriously and took a historic decision on it and thus the Ministry of Welfare was created and this Ministry started working independently. Several Departments attached to the Home Ministry including the Department of Harijan Welfare and other Departments looking after the welfare of minorities disabled people and other weaker sections of the society were detached from the Home Ministry and put under the Ministry of Welfare. Apart from this steps were also taken for the fulfilment of several commitments made by the Government as also of those tasks which the Government was supposed to do under the Directive Principles incorporated in our Constitution and which were left unattended to even after 48 years of Independence. Although our Constitution calls upon the Government to take steps so as to make the weaker sections and the disabled self-reliant so that they do not become a burden on the society it is regrettable that we have not been able to formulate any national policy in this regard. A national policy for children was announced but appropriate steps were not taken in the right direction for the implementation of that policy. The work was taken up but much remains to be done in this direction because our country has not been able to progress as much as it should have. For this purpose it is necessary to have adequate resources. Today the situation is that due to non-availability of resources we are not able to allocate as much money as we would have liked for our programmes. The previous Government had constituted a committee and the committee was entrusted with the job of suggesting a national policy for the handicapped keeping in mind the factors such as the facilities that could be provided to them ways and means to provide them with equipment and assistance and also ways and means to provide them with education and training in the cities so that instead of being a burden on the society and depending on their parents they can make themselves useful and make a place in the society. The committee was to give its recommendations on these issues. I would like the present Government to take steps to implement the recommendations made by this committee and also keep in mind those recommendations while formulating the Bill relating to the handicapped because so far we have not been able to formulate the requisite national policy for the handicapped. Many experts have expressed their views after much discussion and deliberations. The Government should take steps to implement those recommendations. I believe that this House will unanimously agree that there should definitely be a national policy regarding the handicapped so that they need not depend on others. There are many countries in the world when many special laws have been made for the welfare of the handicapped and they are provide with many additional facilities. We too can formulate a national policy for the handicapped on the lines of those formulated by other Governments. Mr. Chairman Sir as I said in the beginning the rate of infant mortality in our country is very high due to many reasons including poverty mal-nutrition and under-nourishment. Similarly many children are deprived of proper education as they fall victims of bad habits. We have observed that in many families the parents are illiterate or they are so busy in their work that they are not able to pay proper attention to their children. Some of these parents work as labourers while some others are engaged in similar menial jobs. The previous Government had formulated passed and implemented the Juvenile Justice Act. I would like the Government to make adequate arrangements to see that the Act is fully implemented in all the States and that none of its provisions is violated. The children are the future of our country and as such cannot be neglected. Tomorrow they are going to shoulder the responsibility of the nation. Along with the industrial development and progress in many fields we are witnessing the onset of many services in our country. Ours is a welfare state. It is our responsibility to see that vices of our children are removed.",
158: "Madam Chairman I rise to support the Railway Budget. At the outset I congratulate the Hon’ble Minister for presenting a socio-economic development-oriented Budget for the first time by giving concessional and free journey facility by rail to war and police windows disabled and industrial workers awarded for productivity and technological innovation. This will certainly boost the morale of workers for increasing productivity. I am not happy at the second class fare increase. Due to financial constraints the Hon’ble Minister has been forced to increase the second class rail fare. The second class rail fare should not have been increased and the passengers should have been spared of this increase in second class fare. The Hon’ble Minister has announced several measures to modernise and improve the working of the Railways. The Railways are the life-line of the nation. Therefore the Railways in India really need upgradation and modernization. We are lagging behind in modern rail facilities when compared to the advanced countries. I am glad that the Hon’ble Minister has laid emphasis on the modernization of the Railways. Adequate funds should be provided to implement modernization programmes. The Indian Railways have made distinct improvements during the first three years of the Seventh Plan. The Hon’ble Minister deserves congratulations for this but many more works are yet to be undertaken and I hope with the efficiency and dedication of the Ministry as well as with the dynamic Minister the Indian Railways will make further improvements in the remaining years of the Seventh Plan. Sir I thank the Hon’ble Minister for exempting goods rate hike in respect of certain commodities like fertilizers foodgrains fodder livestock pulses edible oils salt etc. These are the essential commodities of common use. So this exemption will provide a great relief to the common man. Large parts of the country faced an unprecedented drought during 1987. The Railways ensured massive movement of diesel foodgrains and edible oils to the drought-affected areas. The track restoration work in the North-Eastern parts of the country after the flood was also commendable. Despite all these hurdles the freight performance of the Railways has surpassed the annual target. The credit goes to the employers and workers of the Railways for these performances. I thank the Hon’ble Railway Minister for performing such a challenging task in an extremely efficient and commendable way. Sir 64 new trains have been introduced during 1987-88. The frequency of some existing trains has also been increased. There was a demand to provide track service between capitals of southern States and the National capital Delhi. I am happy to say that superfast express services have been provided between Delhi and capitals of the four southern States – Bangalore Hyderabad Madras and Thiruvananthapuram – during 1987-88. The Minister has given a list of some new trains proposed to be introduced from 1st May 1988. Now I would like to say a word about computerization of passenger reservation. The Government have taken steps in this respect. But it is limited to Delhi and a few metropolitan cities. I am glad to learn that computerized passenger reservation facility is going to be introduced at some other cities like Ahmedabad Bangalore Bhopal Lucknow and Hyderabad. I urge upon the Government to extend such a facility to Mysore also. I would like to say a few words about my State of Karnataka. Karnataka is very deficient on broad gauge compared to other States in the South. Therefore I would like to press for a more rapid conversion of the trunk routes in that State into broad gauge. There is reluctance on the part of the trade and industry to expand their industrial establishment and trade. The broad gauge would provide them uninterrupted rail transit for their raw materials and finished goods. The conversion of Bangalore-Mysore Railway line into broad gauge was sanctioned during 1979. The estimate cost of the project was Rs. 26 crores. Now it has further gone up. The amount spent on this project is about six crores of rupees only. The Budget provision made for this project in 1985-86 and 1986-87 was very inadequate. Therefore I would like to request the Hon’ble Minister to provide sufficient funds for this conversion project so that it can be completed by the end of the Seventh Plan. I would like to say here that the people of Karnataka feel neglected as adequate funds are not allocated to the various projects. The people of Karnataka have been demanding for a separate South-Western Railway Zone. Recently there was an agitation over this issue. This is a genuine demand of the people of Karnataka which they have been pressing for long. The Government of India should take immediate steps to set up a separate South-Western Railway Zone with Bangalore as its headquarters.",
159: "Sir at the outset I may mention the Government is not in a position to accept this Resolution. I cannot also subscribe to the assumption which is contained in this Resolution. The assumption is that there is shortage of agricultural labour in the country. Sir we have had enquiries conducted with regard to this matter. There has been the agricultural labour enquiry conducted by the Ministry of Labour in the year 1990-91 and there have been the enquiries conducted under the auspices of the Planning Commission also and I do not want to tire the House with the figures contained in the Labour Enquiry Committee Report and also in the chapter on agricultural workers which is contained in the Seventh Five Year Plan. Suffice is to say that the conclusion arrived at by the Planning Commission is that about 30 per cent of rural families are agricultural labourers and according to the Planning Commission this vast number presents a very serious problem. It is also the conclusion of the Planning Commission that the present agricultural production in the country could be maintained with about 75 per cent of the number of workers now engaged in it. Sir it is true as has been stated by my friend that there may be certain pockets in different parts of the country where there may be shortage of agricultural labour. But taking an overall view of the position in the country the problem really is that it is not one of shortage of agricultural labour but one of unemployment and under-employment and that is why Sir so many steps have been suggested by the Planning Commission such as expansion of work opportunities within the rural economy especially through intensive development of village and small-scale industries and also adoption of a measure of redistribution of land and provision of educational facilities and concessions to raise their social status and enable agricultural labour to develop greater confidence initiative and ability to avail themselves of all economic opportunities. There are also suggestions of the Planning Commission which require us to improve the living conditions of the agricultural labourers. Sir with regard to the point that there are certain areas in which there is excess of agricultural labour and certain areas where there is real shortage I have to say that there are plans which have been adopted. Then Sir a point has been raised by the mover that in certain peak seasons there is real difficulty in finding agricultural labour. I may state that there is some difficulty experienced during harvest time and the weeding season when there will be the outbreak of monsoon when replanting of seedlings will have to be done but the situation is not such as to warrant the appointment of a committee to go into this question at all. I would say Sir had it not been for those circumstances existing in certain peak periods when agricultural labour is in a position really to dictate terms it is horrible to conceive of their lot in the slack seasons so that we have to put up with that situation. Even in those seasons as we find there may not be lack of personnel but the labour may be in a position to dictate terms. They may demand and get increased wages at that particular period whereas they may have to be satisfied with very low wages in other parts of the year. So Sir I feel that it is not possible for the Government to accept this Resolution. Taking India as a whole as I have stated to meet this question of under-employment we have provided in the Seventh Five Year Plan 40 crores of rupees for assisting in the settlement of landless agricultural workers and 500 crores of rupees are proposed to be spend by States for the resettlement of landless agricultural workers. The main lines of development in this regard are encouragement of cottage and small-scale industries large increases in agricultural production including animal husbandry and horticulture. I may also state for the information of the House that the Ministry of Labour are conducting with the help of the National Sample Survey another agricultural labour enquiry to investigate into the scope of employment and living standards of agricultural labourers and this enquiry is expected to bring forth information on all aspects of the subject. The points raised by the mover from the subject-matter of the enquiry that would be conducted. Sir with regard to the questions raised by Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee they are larger questions and they are dealt with in the Seventh Five Year Plan itself. The Government is taking necessary steps in the direction of consolidation of holdings and the latest position of the Planning Commission itself is that it would render aid in the matter of consolidation of holdings so that there may not be fragmentation. The greatest importance that has been attached to developments in cooperation is quite known to the Hon’ble Members.",
160: "I crave the indulgence of the House for making this statement on the opening day of the Parliament as I wish to take Hon’ble Members into confidence at the earliest opportunity about the extremely difficult foreign exchange position in which we find ourselves at present. Our foreign exchange reserves have declined more or less steadily during the current fiscal year. Some decline during the months of April-September when export receipts are usually low is a normal feature of our balance of payments. The decline in reserves during April-September 1984 however was almost twice as large as in the same period of 1983. The decline in reserves has continued during the past 4 or 5 months when we should normally be gaining reserves in order to meet the requirements of the coming lean season for exports. On February 12 1985 the foreign assets of the Reserve Bank stood at about Rs. 700 crores. As Hon’ble Members are aware the Reserve Bank is required to hold a minimum Rs. 800 crores of reserve in the form of gold and foreign securities. The Reserve Bank has been able in fact to abide by this requirement for some time only on the basis of a transfer to the Bank of gold which the Government had acquired over the years. The recent decline in reserves is the result of a variety of factors. In view of shortages of foodgrains in the country and the pressure on prices we have had to provide for larger imports of food and fertilizers against free foreign exchange. Payments on account of defence imports have also been increasing; and we have had to provide for larger repayment obligations in respect of the growing volume of our indebtedness abroad. While exports have been rising the increase this year had not been as large as in 1983-84; and it has not been reflected fully in the receipt of foreign exchange. A part of the increase in exports has been to countries with whom settlements in trade and payments are made in rupees. There is reason to believe that export earnings have been lower because of higher interest rates elsewhere. A part of the decline in reserves may therefore be short-term in character and may be expected to reverse itself. First and foremost we have to reduce inflationary pressures in the economy. The strictest fiscal and monetary discipline has to be observed in the interest both of stability of prices and of improvement in the payments position. The Budget of the Central Government for the year 1985-86 will be announced in ten days from now and I do not wish to say anything about this at this stage. But it is clear that the financial operations of the Central and State Governments as well as those of public and private sector enterprises will necessarily have to be guided by the over-riding consideration of avoiding inflation. I have taken this up with the State Governments and I have no doubt that in the present grave situation I can count on their whole-hearted co-operation. On the monetary side several measures have been taken during the past year to bring about an orderly increase in interest rates and to slow down the pace of monetary expansion. The Reserve Bank has just announced further measures to this end. The Bank rate has been increased from 5 per cent to 6 per cent. Coupled with this the terms governing the rates at which scheduled banks are eligible to borrow from the Reserve Bank has been made stiffer. Banks will be able to borrow at the Bank rate only when their net liquidity ration comes to 30 per cent or more as against 28 per cent at present. The borrowing rate of the individual scheduled bank will increase by 1/2 per cent for every 1 per cent decline in its liquidity ratio below 30 per cent. The Reserve Bank has also taken steps to make appropriate changes in other interest rates in the economy. Thus banks have been asked to raise the interest rates on their term deposits as well as savings bank deposits. The ceiling limit to the lending rates of banks has been raised from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. The Reserve Bank leading rate to co-operative banks would also now be higher by 1 per cent. Appropriate changes in other interest rates including those paid and charged by Government and other financial institutions are also being made. These measures should limit the expansion of bank credit and bring about an appreciable reduction in inflationary pressures in general by encouraging a greater flow of savings and a greater sense of economy in the use of scarce capital resources. The Reserve Bank will watch carefully the expansion of credit and money supply in the economy in the light of the genuine requirements of growing production.",
161: "Mr. Deputy Chairman after all all labour legislations in all countries have to be gradually evolved and what is good in one country cannot be wholesale copied in another country because it is to have reference to the economic conditions and also to the employment or unemployment factor in that country. Countries gradually develop industries and other social conditions but short of a revolution it is not possible to put into practice all the things of which we approve in principle. We have come to a very much higher stage as far as the interests of the workers are concerned during the last fifteen years and although we would like to see that even in the agricultural field minimum wages are guaranteed such States which tried to bring in minimum wages legislation as long ago as about six years back found it impossible to put it into practice as has been already referred to by another Hon’ble Member due to the reasons of expense of implementation and the existing conditions. Supposing I would ask the Members on the other side we were to make rules about minimum wages with regard to domestic servants what would happen? All that would happen is that people would stop engaging servants because they are unable to pay them and the result would be that there would be more unemployment. I need not develop this point further because it is for this reason that it has been found difficult to apply the minimum wages in the case of agricultural labourers. Sir I know for a fact that in some place where the employees thought that minimum wages would be enforced in regard to agricultural labour they stopped cultivating certain portions of the land and the result was that the land remained fallow. So we have to take the overall position the balanced picture into consideration and though always aiming as the Government is certainly aiming at bettering the conditions of the unemployed and bringing about the socialist pattern in as rapid a manner as possible we have to see that the very objectives for which we stand are not defeated. Sir I would like to say another word with regard to the remarks made about bringing in an Ordinance with reference to the recent strike. Sir only when people are saddled with some responsibilities they have to realise that they have to take certain steps. I am sure Sir even the people on the Opposition side who are today in power in Kerala would be able to say what success they got with their experimenting because without making the State banking without borrowing we have to see that our purse is long enough to meet the charges on it. For that very reason I would ask what they would have done if at the eleventh hour there is a sudden demand on the Exchequer a demand such that it would not be able to bear without unfairness to the other services. I would also ask Sir a question which I have not been able to ask of the many people who should perhaps be held responsible for replying to the question and that is that in deciding on a certain minimum wage we have to see that in giving more to one sector of industry we do not do injustice to the other sector. I know Sir that in deciding on minimum wages we have to take so many factors into consideration. Now in the coal industry first they were given a wage of Rs. 690 and the unions there were not fully satisfied and they had demanded a wage of Rs. 13200. Having gone deep into the pros and cons of the matter they were ultimately on appeal given only Rs. 8000 although it was felt that for a minimum standard of living particularly in that hazardous industry Rs. 13200 for a worker with a wife and two children were just enough to give a standard of what we may call a cultural life. But Sir one would ask what do the people in other places get. I am leaving aside the coal industry because mining on the whole is a very hazardous industry. Let us take the other concerns like the Railways for instance or the Postal Department which was in the news till the other day and now the Station Masters have given notice of their demands and their strike. Now let us take the postal employees. Should we not ask these people to consider how far in order to hold the balance even we will be able to give the same to the other employees under Government in different places? So we can have a solution and we have to have some sort of a solution which will not be an overall solution that people in moffusil places would be paid less or that people employed in large cities where a higher standard of living prevails will be given more.",
162: "Sir the Hon’ble Finance Minister has told us why he has thought fit to bring these Finance Bills in the middle of the year. The plan contemplated a tax of about Rs. 400 crores and now that the Finance Minister does not want to take recourse to deficit financing naturally the tax has got to be increased and it now comes to about Rs. 1300 crores. Therefore money must come from wherever it can be had and some sort of tax has to be imposed. Now the proposals have to be examined from that point of view. Some people have acclaimed the proposals as very necessary and well-considered while others have found ground for criticizing them. Whatever may be the taxation measures if they are applied properly and with sympathy even measures which are not liked can be made to be appreciated and less objected to. I have no doubt as the Finance Minister himself said that he will see that the measures are sympathetically administered and if that is done most of the objections that might be and have been put forward to the proposals would be removed. As you may remember when the Five Year Plan was discussed in this House and in the other House some of the Members felt that perhaps a very optimistic view might have been taken of the resources that may be available for carrying out the Five Year Plan. Even now people feel that the Plan has got to be implemented and a lot depends on the implementation of the Plan but the question is: have we taken note correctly of the resources that are available and have we not over-estimated and taken rather an optimistic view? But implementation of the Plan will not be very much affected if instead of five years a few more months are taken to implement it. What I mean to say is if the resources are not sufficient to carry out the Plan in five years there is no harm in increasing the period by a few months so that there may not be a very heavy strain on our resources and so that things may not go wrong on account of the heavy strain that may be put thereon. Another thing that can be looked into very conveniently is whether or not a certain amount of savings can be effected. So far as the proposals in the two Bills are concerned I have one or two suggestions to make. One is as regards the capital gains tax. Most of the exemptions that were in the previous Act have been removed but I feel that so far as capital gains in respect of compulsory acquisition by Government is concerned that should still continue to be exempted. When a person sells his capital asset and makes a gain which is called unearned profit he may be taxed and perhaps he will have no justification in raising any objection. But when a property is acquired which he does not want to sell but which is acquired under compulsion at the instance of the Government for the use of the Government in the case of such a compulsory acquisition there is no real justification for making the man pay capital gains tax also especially when he never wanted to part with his property and in fact he objected thereto but had to part with it because the authorities wanted him to do that. That is one small suggestion so far as capital gains tax is concerned and I think in a case where compulsory acquisition takes place it is for the Government to consider whether or not they will think of giving relief to the unfortunate person who may have to part with his property in spite of himself. Another suggestion that I have to make is that so far as compulsory deposit is concerned the people who are conservative and who have put in careful and prudent management and have built up resources generally use them for the purpose of increasing the volume of business and stabilizing the position of the company but here the position is just as if you are going to penalize those companies which have prudently managed which have been managed in a conservative manner and which have not frittered away their resources. Some consideration should be shown to such companies that have built up resources and have utilised them in expanding their business so that they may not be called upon to put in these compulsory deposits. Otherwise wasteful expenditure will be encouraged and the management which have not been taking proper care for conserving their resources will get a premium. Then my friend said that equity shares had increased in value to the extent of 150 times depending on the number of years. Here the dividend that is going to be taxed is on the basis of the paid-up capital which does not take into account the reserves built up over a number of years.",
163: "Sir the House will remember that over the past few years that we have been here we have been demanding a change in the structure of our taxation and it is only this year we have heard the Finance Minister announce that the time has come when the tax structure of our country must be changed. What exactly is the change in the tax structure that is going to be made still remains to be seen. Only the other day on the 3rd November in Calcutta Mr. Pant Chairman of the Finance Commission was stating that the financial stability of the State and the Central Governments as well as the successful implementation of the Eighth Five Year Plan depended to a large extent on a radical change of outlook of the people towards taxation. In that speech he also made it clear that he would expect the common people to pay more taxes. Now if the change of structure of the taxation system is to be sought in order to continue to exact the limited savings of the common man deprive him of the necessities of life then I would not be in favour of any such change. If however the tax structure were to be changed for a policy that would make the rich pay for the Eighth Five Year Plan I would be in favour of it. I make it clear that it has never been the contention of the people that they would not bear the responsibility of building up the country. In fact our workers in the factories are sweating day in and day out so that our industrial production goes up. If today we claim higher industrial output it is precisely because our men in the wheels of industry have so behaved themselves and have so worked for the well being of the country that despite the machinations and intrigues of the capitalist class despite their greed for more and more profits it has been possible to bring about a sizeable increase in the industrial output. The credit entirely belongs to the working people of our country. Similarly if in the agrarian sector of our economy the production of food has gone up simultaneously raising thereby the total national income that is also because of the fact that the peasants – however poor however destitute and however suffering have responded to the call of the Government. It is only because of their devotion to duty for the cause of the country that we are today in a position to claim before the whole world that our agricultural production has gone up. I say this because we must remember that it is the people who are paying with their blood paying with their sweat for the rebuilding of our country’s economy for the rejuvenation of our nation. Our capitalist friends who regard themselves as the captains of industry and have produced more ship wrecks than happy sailings would please note this particular fact that it is these men working people whether in the agricultural sector or the industrial sector who are responsible for the rise in production and therefore it is they who have brought about an increase in the national income from which they have been denied their legitimate share. Mr. Deputy Chairman now we are discussing the question of taxes. The Finance Minister is in a very chastened mood these days. I think that he is in a very happy posture of mind today when he makes such speeches. He forgets that merely by taking money from the rich you don’t distribute to the poor. We have seen in the United States in Germany in England where heavy taxation measures obtain at the same time relatively speaking the poverty of the people continues. Sometimes it so happens that the ruling class the capitalist class for their common general interest which is certainly something broader than the interest of shall we say the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry when they promote certain broad interests of the class as a whole where various factors operate not merely the fluctuations in the stock market they are obliged to take certain measures which sometimes even evidently and manifestly hit against what appears to be their immediate interest but that should not delude us into thinking that the capitalist class in our country or for that matter that this Government has adopted a policy of making the rich pay for the poor. That is not at all so and the Rs. 1600 crores or so out of which only Rs. 1000 crores would come from the direct taxes should not make us think that there has been a radical change in this direction that we all desire. We welcome the halting step that the Minister takes. We welcome the steps however belated and we welcome even the pick-pocketing of the capitalists. It requires only a pick-pocket to get Rs. 1000 crores from the capitalist class. Even when they do such things we always welcome them.",
164: "Madam I would like to say a few words. It was not my intention to speak on this Bill at all but having listened to the speech of the Hon’ble Minister towards the end of his reply I am rather provoked shall I say frankly to say a word or two about the policy of the Government in the matter. It is pointless for the Government and the Minister here to tell us that there has not been any shift in the policy with regard to foreign participation and the role of foreign enterprise in the oil industry of our country. Now we do not have the time nor the opportunity just at the time to recall the various utterances and statements given solemnly on the floor of this House and in the other House by the then Hon’ble Minister Mr. Malaviya and others of the Government also enunciating certain basic approaches to questions of policy. What was it? In the first place it was decided after a lot of groping in the dark in the earlier stages that as far as the oil industry was concerned it should be from now on developed entirely in the public sector and a beginning was made by exploration and the setting up of refineries with the co-operation of friendly countries like Rumania. That is how we began. You will remember Madam Vice-Chairman as other Members in this House will remember that when the Burmah-Shell and the Standard Vacuum Oil Company demanded full expansion of their installed capacity the demand was first sought to be entertained by certain elements in the Government but ultimately the Government did not sanction even the expansion of the installed capacity by those concerns. The argument at that time and a right argument at that was that we should be given the opportunity and we should take the opportunity now of developing our own public sector and making the public sector much more pronounced that it would be in a matter of two or three years by stopping the expansion in the private sector as well. Therefore we had a double policy at that time. I am not a spokesman of the Government but I do know the policy of the Government because these are public policies. What was that policy? It was on the one hand to create a public sector in the oil industry. You will remember Madam and the House will remember that when we negotiated for certain oil to be imported from the Soviet Union these foreign concerns American and British had the temerity to say that they would not be refining crude oil if it was imported from socialist countries and not from their own sources. After a lot of hesitation in the matter the Government ultimately and rightly so compelled these people to accept the crude oil imported from other sources than their own. This was the position. Now these are not forgotten stories and I may recall in this connection that the journal called ‘Commerce’ wrote a series of editorial articles in which the Hon’ble Minister of Oil at that time was criticised precisely for pursuing an exclusive policy of public sector development in the matter of oil and these criticisms were repeated also in certain other foreign journals including the journals that emanate from the United States of America. It is also well known that at that time Mr. B.K. Nehru was approached by certain elements in the U.S.A. and following that a New York paper wrote a certain article saying that Mr. B.K. Nehru’s visit to India would be helpful in getting the oil policy of Mr. Malaviya reversed in the direction in which the Americans would like. The article appeared and I quoted this article on the floor of the House. If you would read also other economic journals you would find that a great debate continued for months and months with regard to what should be the oil policy of the Government and in that debate up to the time I am referring to the Government clearly asserted that oil should be developed exclusively in the public sector in all its stages especially in refining and exploration. We took certain steps. That is how such developments have taken place. The mentality of foreign equity participation was not there. Had it been so we would not have had the fine refining centres in our country. We would not have been developing our industry in the way we have done in the course of the past few years. Now that vigorous policy was pursued although we would have liked it to be much more vigorous than actually it was. then what happened? Systematic pressures were brought to bear upon the Government in order to compromise this policy to make the Government resile from the position that it had taken. In that connection you will remember Sir that the Sahni Committee made a report with regard to the operations of the foreign oil concerns.",
165: "The reasons why a development bank of this kind is necessary are not very difficult to understand. The size of the allocation for industrialisation in the first two five years plans was not on the whole so great as to strain the resources of the existing financial institutions including banks. But latterly the gaps in the present institutional framework for the provision of industrial credit especially for medium and long term periods have come to light. This I think was inevitable. With a projected outlay of Rs. 3100 crores for industrialisation in the Third Five Year Plan and with rising costs it would have been surprising if the needs of industry could have been promptly or fully satisfied within our existing resources. As it is the establishment of a high powered agency which may be able to undertake residual responsibility or ultimately for promoting or accelerating industrial growth has become urgently necessary. I am not unmindful Sir while I am saying this of the effort which banks and other industrial finance corporations have been making to adapt themselves to the changes which are being brought about as a result of rapid industrialisation. Bank advances this year at the peak of the busy season reached a record level and nearly sixty per cent of the advances are now granted for industrial purposes. In the case of the State Bank of India which is our leading commercial bank the figure I believe is even higher. Three-fourths of the State Bank’s advances I understand are sanctioned to industrial units. Although there has been this notable change in the outlook of the banking system and although we have been facilitating this change by providing liquidity or refinance to the banks they will find it increasingly difficult to provide the additional resources. There are many other competing demands on the resources of the banking system; and banks have also some statutory obligations in the matter of maintain a specified percentage of their resources in cash or approved investments. In any case the ability of the commercial banking system to assist industry is dependent in the long run on an increase in deposits. While banks can and should try to help the industry it will be unrealistic to think that in the existing phase of development they can continue to carry the burden of financing industrial enterprises without any external aid or assistance. We have a number of specialized agencies like the Industrial Finance Corporation and the State Finance Corporations but they operate within certain limitations. Their capital or other resources are no longer adequate in relation to the total volume of the demand for long and medium-term credit. The conditions in which or the security against which they can grant loans or other assistance are also rigid. Industrial units which need substantial capital of the order of more than one or two crores of rupees or entrepreneurs planning for additions to capital or investment over a period of years do not in many cases have the assurance that the existing agencies will be able to provide for these needs. In the existing conditions in which there is an acute shortage of capital in relation to demand new enterprises which do not have the backing of the better known managing agency houses or the assistance of foreign collaborators are particularly likely to be affected. These enterprises although they may be deserving often tend to be overlooked or passed over in favour of other parties. We are envisaging the Industrial Development Bank as an institution designed to overcome these limitations and to accelerate the process of industrial growth. This new institution will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India. It will be managed by a board consisting of the Directors of the Central Board of the Reserve Bank. The Bill provides that the Governor of the Reserve Bank will be the Chairman of the Industrial Development Bank and that a Deputy Governor in the Reserve Bank to be specially appointed for this purpose will be the Vice-Chairman. In view of its close association with the central bank of the country the Industrial Development Bank will be able to draw on the knowledge and experience of that bank and to obtain in its day-to-day operation such guidance and assistance as may be necessary. The Industrial Development Bank as I have indicated already will have the residual responsibility of ensuring that no deserving industrial enterprise which get an allocation or is accorded a priority in our Five Year Plans will be allowed to suffer for want of financial resources or assistance. For discharging this very onerous responsibility in an adequate manner the Industrial Development Bank will have substantial funds of its own in the form of capital subscribed by the Reserve Bank of India. We are expecting the new institution to issue capital to the extent of Rs. 100 crores. Like all other institutions the Industrial Development Bank will be able to borrow money from the Reserve Bank.",
166: "I should like to deal only with some important Departments. I shall take first the Defence Department. The allocation to the Defence Department which in the Budget of the last year was Rs. 800 crores has been reduced to about Rs. 700 crores. Is it because the Defence requirements have diminished in number? I have come to know that recruitment to the Forces has been stopped. At what number has it been stopped? In the present emergency soon after the incursion of the Chinese it was hoped that our Defence Forces would be raised to the number of two millions. Has at least one million been reached so far? The war with China can never be considered to be a war of limited liability. Modern wars are wars of wars of unlimited liability and we cannot say that recruitment of half a million troops would be just enough to meet the requirements of national Defence. For let us remember that there are not two fronts the Ladakh front and the NEFA front that we have to deal with but there is the Pakistan front also that we have to contend with and the Pakistan front consists of two fronts one on the west and one on the east. I should like the Defence Ministry to consider whether the recruitment so far attained is enough to meet our Defence requirements on all these four fronts. Then in regard to weapons I find no provision is made of the manufacture of machine guns which are so necessary in modern warfare especially to stop the incursion of large masses of troops such as we experienced at the time of the Chinese incursion on the NEFA border. We have been promised that in course of time the naval defence would be supplied with that modern weapon of defence namely the submarine. To this end officers have been sent to the United Kingdom to learn how to handle submarines. I hope and trust that very soon we shall acquire at least two submarines. I would suggest that the useless aircraft carrier which serves no defence purpose at all at present upon which Rs. 30 crores were spent and the maintenance of which comes to about six crores of rupees a year might be sold to some power that requires an aircraft carrier and the amount thus realised might be spent on the purchase of submarines. Mr. Vice-Chairman I now come to another important Department the Department of External Affairs which also swallows a large part of the Budget. We have as many as 129 Missions. We have had these Missions for the past fifteen years and I think it is time that the External Affairs Ministry began to consider the question whether all these 129 Missions are required. Why do we want Missions in Latin American countries which have no political diplomatic or international connections with India? For trade purposes certainly we should have some representatives but then consular officials would be enough for this purpose and we need not maintain these costly Embassies and Missions in the countries of Latin America. Looking at the Report of the Ministry of External Affairs. I find a reference made to relations with foreign powers. Relations with Afghanistan and Burma our immediate neighbours our near neighbours are reported to be friendly. About Pakistan nothing is said about relations. The obvious inference is that the relations are not friendly. But what about the countries of South East Asia? These are countries with which we should have friendly relations but there is no reference at all in the Report to the relations – whether friendly or hostile – with the South East Asian countries. For the defence of India and for the defence of the whole South Asia especially South East Asia friendly relations with the South East Asian countries are absolutely necessary. In order to establish these friendly relations with foreign countries visits of important persons from the President downwards have been arranged but what are our Missions doing in several countries in order to maintain and promote friendly relations with India? Are they allowed to take initiative? Are they allowed to be active in the promotion of friendly relations or are they to be content merely with carrying out the orders from the Ministry of External Affairs? What information diplomatic economic military do these Missions abroad convey to India? For instance in regard to the Chinese invasion of India was the Military Attache able to send useful reports upon the military situation upon the military intentions of China? It is no doubt difficult in totalitarian countries in communist countries for foreign Missions to get enough information but from the experience of Missions maintained by the United Kingdom by the United States of America these countries are able to get valuable military and other useful information from their representatives abroad. Or is it the fact that our Military Attaches Commercial Attaches send reports to our Ministries but the External Affairs lay these reports aside?",
167: "The next item of expenditure which has attracted my notice is the expenditure on pensions. As much as 100 crores of rupees have been allotted for payment of pensions and other relief. May I once more point out to the Finance Ministry the hardship which people who have commuted their pension are suffering from? Some of the people who have commuted their pension have had the misfortune to live up to seventy to eighty years and have paid their commuted portion twice and still this Government exacts these payments from these commuted pensioners. I think the time has come when the Finance Ministry should look sympathetically at the lot of the commuted pensioners and restore the original pension at least five to six years after they have paid up the full commuted amount. Then I come to that white elephant in our Government namely the Planning Commission which costs us Rs. 10 crores. On a former occasion when I made the remark that our Planning Commission is the costliest in the world the Minister of State for Finance said that the French Planning Commission was as large if not larger and it was as costly as our Planning Commission. I challenged him to produce the figures. He said he had not the figures. I made some personal enquiries of the French Embassy in Delhi and they tell me that there is no special staff for the French Planning Commission that the staff that try to implement the suggestions of the French Planning Commission are distributed over several ordinary Ministries so that no special cost is incurred on the staff of the Planning Commission. Why should we not have a Planning Commission composed of representative experts honorary experts like the Planning Commissions of other countries experts from industry from labour from the professions from the private sector as well as the public sector who give competent and useful advice on planning to the Government? As at present constituted the Planning Commission is composed of people who are pledged to one social philosophy namely the socialist philosophy because the Planning Commission and the Government plan not for prosperity but for socialism. If the Planning commission is to plan for prosperity if the Government are to work for economic prosperity the Planning commission should be composed of representative experts from interests which are engaged in the promotion of economic growth. Very often we find in the reports of Ministries the phrase that the Planning Commission has allotted so much money to this Department or to that Ministry. Who or what is the Planning Commission to allot sums of money? It is the Government Departments that should allot it is the Ministry the Cabinet that should allot sums of money to this or that Department. That shows that the Planning Commission has become another Department of Government. If it has become another Department of Government then why should it not be brought into the general system of Government in the administration made a regular Department of Government so that it may be made responsible to this House? Now it is a body with power but without responsibility. It is time therefore that the Government made up its mind to make an honest women out of the Planning Commission. Then another Ministry which attracts criticism is the Ministry of Housing which is also charged with the solution of the housing problem in this country. In order to solve the immense housing problem of this country indicated by the calculations of the Planning Commission itself in order to place the housing position of India on a satisfactory footing as many as fifty million rural houses have to be reconstructed. How can Rs. 46 crores go towards the reconstruction of even a small proportion of this large number? I made a suggestion to the consultative Committee of the Ministry of Housing that the Government should consider the question of drafting and introducing into Parliament a housing law imposing housing obligations upon all employers governmental or private from the Centre down to the villages. I was told of certain practical difficulties which stood in the way. One difficulty pointed out by the Ministry was that investment on industrial development would be considerably reduced if so much money was spent on housing. But has the Government considered that housing itself is an investment an economic investment? Satisfactory housing would promote the health and strength of the workers and the competitive capacity of the workers would be increased if decent housing conditions were provided. Another objection raised to the drafting and introduction of a housing law by the Ministry was that it should increase the cost of production and therefore in a competitive market in a competitive world market we would not be able to sell our steel goods. This was exactly the excuse raised during the British days that if the wages of the workers were increased we could not compete in the world market. Therefore the wages of the workers had to suffer all along.",
168: "Sir the three wings of Defence – the Army the Navy and the Air Force – require to be well equipped and modernized. Ours is a country with a great population. I know our difficulties also. In the present world situation it will not be possible for us to remain second rate in regard to possession of modern armaments. Defence is a very complicated problem nowadays in this world. We have not got that technical know-how; we have not got those technicians who can manufacture modern weapons in our country. Even then the Defence Ministry is efficient. It has tried to manufacture as far as possible new machinery and modern weapons. Then the problem of development is equally or if I may say more important. It all depends upon how we progress. To shape the future of our country requires huge funds of money. We are a poor country. And I am told that taxation in our country is the highest compared to other countries of the world. The question therefore arises as to how we shall meet the situation. New wealth has to be created new sources of wealth have to be explored and in these matters we cannot depend upon friendly countries for coming to our aid in times of necessity. The country must have that self-reliance and in course of time it should be our aim to reach that stage when this country can produce all its requirements can have its own defence can have its own development and can stand on its own legs. If I were to dilate on this it will take a very long time and everybody in this House knows the difficulties and the complications of the situation. But even then I might suggest that this question of development requires to be very carefully handled. Now wealth comes from two sources one is agriculture and the other is industry. And agriculture is the main base for development purposes. But what do we find about the position of agriculture in our country? I think our Prime Minister suggested that in all the States the Chief Minister should take over the portfolio of Agriculture looking to its importance in the situation. But I do not find any Chief Minister caring to accept the suggestion and take over the portfolio of Agriculture in his hands. That shows how serious we are in meeting the situation. Agriculture Sir depends upon millions of small agriculturists in our country and in spite of our planning those who are connected with the rural areas those who are intimately connected with agriculture know that agriculturists do not feel enthused. Despite planning for so many years the same old rut continues. Unless we enthuse them unless we make them feel that they are the builders of the country that they are the moulders of the future of this country agriculture will not prosper. There are so many reasons. But the main reason is that the agriculturist must feel that he has some important place in our country that he is doing a great service by ensuring higher production. For that purpose it is very necessary that the per acre production must increase. More land is not available for cultivation. Population is rising by leaps and bounds. There is the question of unemployment. And also we find that the pressure on land is very much. If we want agriculture to prosper that pressure on land the number of human beings dependent on agriculture has to be reduced and where shall we divert them? If they go to urban areas for employment they do not get it. The figure of unemployment is rising everyday. Therefore it is very necessary to see that some industries are diverted to rural areas. We should create agro-industrial climate in the country. We have been talking of creating this climate all these years. But in that part of the country from which I come I have not seen any industries on a necessary scale being established in the rural areas. Unless we do this the youngsters from the rural areas are bound to come to the cities. There will be the question of unemployment the question of housing the question of sanitation. All these problems will arise. It is very necessary that we find useful employment for them in the rural areas in the villages in which they live and they must have a decent standard of living. With the progress of primary education with these new modes of transport people from the villages now come frequently to the cities and see what facilities what amenities are available in the cities and how backward their villages are comparatively in respect of these amenities and they feel dissatisfied with the life they lead and therefore they are inclined to go in for better prospects for a better life. They want to go to the cities. That is also a very serious situation for the Government to consider. The problem of rural employment must be solved on a war footing.",
169: "I would like to congratulate the Finance Minister for the very good Budget that he has presented to us. As far as I have known this is the only Budget that was presented without any additional taxes being imposed on us particularly at a time when there is emergency and when there is a big influx of refugees coming over from Pakistan. He must be congratulated for having managed to present a Budget like this without any additional taxation. Though it is true that there are no additional taxes imposed quite a number of Members have criticised the Budget and the proposals that have been presented to us. It is natural because this is the only time when Members can criticise the policies and the actions of the Government. Anything can be taken up and discussed and the whole administration of the Government can be criticised at the time of the Budget discussion. But although Mr. Krishnamachari is so clever as to have managed to present such a Budget he feels irritated over any criticism that is made against him or the Government. That is not necessary. It is natural and it is the duty of the Members to place before the House and before the Government all their grievances and also give the necessary suggestions to the Government to improve the administration and to remove the defects if any. So it is really not necessary that any Member of the Government should feel irritated. They are in a privileged position; they are in a position to rectify any mistake that may be there. So they must take this criticism in a sporting way and consider it an opportunity for them to know the mind of the public and welcome such a criticism. Now for any country the basic necessities are food clothing and shelter. The main criticism during this discussion was that some of the taxes that were imposed last time were not withdrawn. Generally such a thing is not done. It is true that even ordinary people the poorer sections of the community have to pay heavily by way of indirect taxes and it is quite a hardship on them. But the Finance Minister’s defence was that even if these indirect taxes were with-drawn not much benefit would go to the public because the business people would appropriate them in the form of profits and in many other ways. We are willing to pay any number of taxes because after all people will have to pay to the Government to carry on the administration and to face any problem that the country has to face. But the rise in prices is something that is really making the people nervous. It is almost killing the people. The taxes do not matter. It is only once a year that the taxes have to be paid but the high prices for the various articles have to be paid every hour almost in the day and that is what people really mind. Something has to be done about it. Some sort of reply was given but it was not convincing. We are not clear in our mind as to what exactly the Government intends to do to bring down the prices. This is the most important thing and this is the only thing that a greater section of the people is interested in. they would really be happy if something is done about it. The next thing I said was clothing. Even though so many textile mills are coming into existence and huge profits are being made by the millowners the price of cloth is still high. More than all this is the problem of shelter. We have seen during this cold weather how many people in Delhi died for want of shelter. They had to stay on the pavement. It is a disgraceful thing it is a shameful thing that we have not been able to provide some sort of a minimum shelter at least for everybody in our country. The Corporations of the big cities must be compelled by the Union Government to build at least some sort of Kutcha dwellings where these people can go and sleep at night. Some cheap structures can be put up. We find from the papers that the Government are thinking of providing loans for building houses or for purchase of land for construction of buildings and all that. But where is land available? They ask fabulous prices for land particularly in Delhi Bombay and other big cities. Some solution has to be thought of to eliminate this kind of hardship. The next thing is education. I am very glad to say that the present Education Minister has taken up his work very seriously in all earnestness and is trying to bring about a lot of changes for the better. In many States they have introduced compulsory primary education and elementary education and they have also made it free for girls; without having to pay any fees they can study up to high school.",
170: "Mr. Chairman Sir I am grateful to you and this august house for giving me an opportunity to give expression to my feelings on certain topics which are intimately connected with the development of this country. Sir I am a person who has spent more than four decades in the various aspects of education science and technology. I have the privilege of having been associated I may say quite intimately with the various scientific organisations in the country. Apart from this since science education and technology form the foundation upon which depend the development and prosperity of this country I should like at the moment to confine my observations only to these topics. We have been very much interested to learn from the papers the various types of schemes that are being put up for the development of the subjects by the Ministry of Education. In fact there have been so many types of projects and so many types and patterns of education and so much money is being spent that it gives us hope that sooner than later the standard of achievement in our country with regard to these subjects will be raised. As a matter of fact very often the indication of the progress that has been made or is being made in these subjects is estimated by the amount of money that is allotted for the development of these subjects. While I shall always appreciate the amount of money that is set apart for these developments I should at the same time feel that the net result of these expenses must be more tangible. As a matter of fact personally I would like that even greater amounts of money should be made available for these developments as is the case in a number of advanced countries of the world. But in spite of all this we find that in general there is a sort of dissatisfaction prevailing in our country that the standard of education achieved in our country is not sufficiently high. When all these things are being said and done and when still the results do not fully satisfy the public surely there is something amiss somewhere. In spite of all the money that comes from the national fund and from foreign countries for being spent we find that the standard achieved in our country in science education and technology is far below the desired standard. Let us begin with the universities themselves. We are observing that the universities are growing up in our country like mushrooms. After all what is the basic difference between a university and a college? I need not say that whereas the essential purpose of a college is to impart education in the known branches of subjects the object of a university is both creation and imparting of knowledge. Let us examine the condition of the staff that has been given to so many of these universities. I am very unhappy to give a picture of the present conditions. There are many universities which have been in existence for a number of years and still a large number of posts especially senior posts are still unfilled. If we go on creating universities like this and if we do not succeed in getting the proper type of teaching staff how can we expect that the universities would be able to discharge their responsibilities? The present position in many of the universities is that a fresh young man who just passes his Master’s examination say in June just at the beginning of July is being put in charge of teaching not only the under-graduate classes but even the M.A. and M.Sc. classes. Everyone knows the system of examination that is unfortunately prevailing in our country. How do the young men pass the examinations? Most of them just try to cram the subjects. Without undergoing any serious effort to study properly and master their subjects thanks to the system of examination they often succeed in getting very high percentage of marks and then they are appointed to the staff. Naturally we cannot expect that this type of teachers will be able to give a good account of themselves in teaching the university classes. Then if we take into consideration the libraries and research journals we find that they are very ill-equipped. Now if the condition of the universities be like that how can we expect that our country will advance sufficiently in higher studies and research? There are various organisations set up to impart education in higher fields. There has been much emphasis put on research work and I should say Sir very rightly because unless and until the country could be sufficiently advanced in the matter of research we shall not be able to give a good account of ourselves in the intellectual field in the international world. The point is that with our limited resources will it not be worthwhile that with the money available we should be able to get an adequate and reasonable return.",
171: "The debate generally Madam has strayed beyond the scope of the report of the Committee. In fact it has almost been a general resume of the work of this House for the past twelve years of the opportunities we have had or of the opportunities we could have had and that sort of thing. Although many Members have touched on many points still amendments have been tabled only on a few of the Rules. But I do not mean to say that their references to the several points are not quite relevant; certainly they are relevant and they are very useful suggestions. In fact this debate has been very valuable in throwing much light on the Report of this Committee. There is no time at my disposal. So I will very briefly cover some of the points which need reply. Of course many points do need reply but I will take some points which are very relevant and reply very briefly. Before going to that I would mention that there was a very factual error committed by one of the Hon’ble Members when he said that although we were revising our Rules at this late stage still we had an advantage over the other House which had not yet done this work. It is not correct. The other House had adopted the Rules under Article 118 on the 22nd December 1986 and later on also the other House had modified those Rules. One or two modifications were adopted next year. So that is not factually correct. Now much of the criticism or suggestion or discussion has centred round the subject of questions. About questions three parts have been made: Admissibility of questions or rejection of questions answering questions and then the various clauses that determine the nature of questions. These are the three aspects on which several Members have made remarks. Now with regard to admissibility several Members have cast some reflection on the Secretariat. Well the Secretariat can only go by the Rules by the conditions prescribed here. Unless we say that these conditions or qualifications for a question should not be there I do not think we can blame the Secretariat. You will remember Madam Deputy Chairman that I was one of those who were putting many questions and I also had the misfortune to have many of my questions rejected. It is true as many of the Hon’ble Members have said that questions which have been rejected on one ground have been admitted again on the same ground. It has happened like that. But that depends upon the particular person handling the question and his interpretation put upon that. However much we may put down these Rules however much a foolproof framework we can devise for the guidance of those who have got to function and deal with these questions still there is the subjective element which we cannot avoid and it is a matter of interpretation. Therefore we should not blame the Secretariat because nobody can say that they do it with any mala fide intention. All that we can say is they can exercise their judgment either wrongly or correctly or indifferently. So it is open to every Member when he feels that his question ought not to have been rejected to go to the Secretariat sit with the concerned section and then discuss with them. That was what I was doing; that is what many of the members have been doing. Then after a discussion either the person understands that his interpretation was wrong or he convinces us that his interpretation was right and that the question as the Rule is framed cannot be admitted. It must be realised that the admissibility or rejection of questions is in the name of the Chairman. Although one section of the Secretariat handles the questions still it is done in the name of the Chairman. So it is not correct propriety to bring the Secretariat into question here. The remedy is open to us to go to them and discuss with them. But the disappointment is there; I have also had that disappointment. It is true that when in one House on one ground a question is rejected in another House on the same ground that question is accepted. It has happened like that. But there can be no remedy except going there and having a personal discussion. With regard to the second point that is answering questions I think some remarks have been made attributing a sort of motive to the Ministers. Madam Deputy Chairman I would humbly like to submit that we should not question the bona fides of the Government. If we begin to question the bona fides of the Government there can be no end to it and we cannot carry on. A Minister may be acting mala fide we must take it that he is acting bona fide. He is not infallible and the Secretariat which furnishes him with answers is also not infallible.",
172: "The job of the Indian Medical Council should be to point out the lacuna and to get the improvements effected and for that purpose the Mudaliar Committee has suggested the appointment of a quinquennial commission to go into the question of medical education as a whole. The Mudaliar Committee has also commented upon the manner in which the Inspectors of Medical Council are appointed. They have suggested that the inspecting body should consist of educationists representing the Union Ministry of Health representative of the University concerned and three experts nominated by the Medical Council. They have said that the persons so chosen should be of at least ten years standing. They want that senior persons should go for inspection and they want that the term of the Inspectors should be between three to five years so that there is uniformity in inspection in the manner in which the institutions are to be upgraded how they are to be improved upon etc. The last one deals with medical ethics. As far as that part is concerned I would like to say that it is the medical standards which are going down or which have gone down. In such matters the Indian Medical Association should be taken into confidence by the Ministry as well as the Medical Council because the maintenance of medical ethics is necessary if we want the noble profession to be called noble and not to be commercialized. The relationship between doctor and doctor the relationship between doctor and consultant and the relationship between consultant and consultant has been a matter which has been there from ages as a convention. Unfortunately in our country healthy conventions have not taken deep roots and we hear off and on complaints which are justified and legitimate. One of the worst complaints is that the registered medical practitioners are issuing certificates which are not warranted by the reasons for which they are issued; I mean they are either false or are given on false pretences. The other place where medical ethics should be enforced is in the matter of medical examination of persons who are proposers for insurance policies. Sometimes there are other reasons why a certain doctor get all the cases while another doctor who is strict and who conducts the examination according to the procedure laid down is not able to get those proposers. It is for the authorities to patronize and encourage those doctors who are ethical who practice medicine in an ethical way and unless and until greater patronage is extended to them or their services are recognised it will not be possible for medical ethics to be observed by all persons properly. I can give an example. There was a general strike of postal workers and about 400 to 500 persons fell sick according to medical certificates on one day. That speaks ill of the profession and it is for the profession to see that such doctors do not lower the prestige of the profession as a whole. This is a good measure. Medical ethics has been brought within the purview of the Medical Council in this bill and I hope by having an all India standard things will be better. On the whole this Bill is one of the best Bills because it has come after the Medical Council has been in existence for some time and the lacunae or the difficulties which they have observed have been removed. But I would request the Minister and through you Madam the Medical Council itself that instead of sending all the reports to the State Ministries concerned they should also correspond with the Universities directly because there are certain medical colleges which are under the Universities and the Universities are autonomous bodies. Those medical colleges are not under the State. I would plead with the Union Ministry of Health as well as the State Ministries to deal with the problem of lowering of standards of education. Whatever lowering of standards has taken place has been because the States have been eager to multiply the number of medical colleges but the required number of teachers is not forthcoming. The experience is not there. If you insist on five years’ experience for a professor it is possible one university may appoint him but another university may not. I know of a case where a person with hardly one year’s experience or no experience at all has been appointed professor; if the same person were to apply to another university he would not be appointed therefore there should be a uniformity of standard maintained in the matter of appointments. Otherwise the universities which are strict institutions which follow the regulations laid down by the Medical Council of India will find that the talents from their institutions fly away to the other institutions where they are not so rigid. In one place if a lecturer cannot become a Reader in another university he becomes a Professor because of the paucity of teachers.",
173: "Madam I rise to support the Bill although with some reservations. This Bill which seeks to amend our Constitution introduces as the previous speaker said no new principle at all. It only facilitates the implementation of a principle already adopted by us by Parliament and by the country. It is an enabling Bill to protect the enactments which have been passed by the various State legislatures in the country. As everybody knows certain enactments were struck down by the courts by the Supreme Court in some cases and by the High Courts in some other cases on the ground that some of the provisions of those enactments were violative of certain Articles of the Constitution. The validity of the Land Reforms Act has been challenged. Now what is to be done? I think there are only two alternatives before us. Either we have to give up once and for all the whole principle of land reforms or we have to amend the Constitution in such a way that the principle of land reforms is protected. There is no other way. Some Hon’ble Members are vociferous about the sanctity of the Constitution. But who wants the sanctity of the Constitution to be violated? It is being argued that this Bill violates the Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constitution. The right to acquire and hold property guaranteed by one of the Articles of the Constitution is interpreted as the right of the landlord to exploit the peasants and amass unearned income. Of course they do not speak for the landlord. They speak for the entire agrarian population. They speak for the small down-trodden peasant proprietors. But does this Bill hurt the peasant proprietors? The bulk of the peasant proprietors in our country hold only very small parcels of land. According to the census of agricultural holdings 82 per cent of the agriculturists hold below 5 acres of land. The Bill does not speak to dispossess them these millions of small peasant proprietors. Only a small number of persons owning large estates owning large proprietary rights only a few big landlords will be affected. In the name of ryotwari settlements these landlords have amassed extensive plots of land extensive holdings. They do not cultivate the land themselves. Some of them cultivate their land with the help of hired labour and others farm them out to tenants sub-tenants or share croppers. Madam it is only just that those who till the land must get the ownership of the land they till and those who own land in excess of the ceiling should be deprived of the excess and the excess distributed to those who are willing to cultivate and who have no land. What is wrong in this? It is true that the security and the so-called Fundamental Rights of a few big landlords are taken away by the Bill. But what about the security and Fundamental Rights of millions of small peasants down trodden peasants who cultivate the land and produce our food? Does the Constitution want that the bulk of the peasant masses and agricultural workers in the countryside should have no right to enjoy the property created by their own labour? That is certainly not the spirit of our Constitution. Our Constitution provides that the ownership and control of the resources of the community are so distributed as to subserve the common good. This Directive Principle is also a fundamental principle more fundamental than the right of the landlord to exploit the peasant. Those who raise the banner of Fundamental Rights I am afraid want the exploitation of the rural poor to continue. They want the landlord to dominate the rural scene for ever. They want to turn the clock back. Madam this private property in land is not an age old institution as some people imagine. Just like the zamindari jagirdari talukdari etc. the ryotwari settlements also were created and sanctified by the British imperialists not for the good of the country but for their own benefit. It was under the British that the feudal upper stratum of the rural society became ryotwari landlords. The middle peasants the small peasants the poor peasants all suffered inthis process. Under the crushing colonial oppression many tillers lost their land lost their private property to the landlords to the money lenders and trader who invested their ill-gotten money in land and became ryotwari land-owners. Thus land became concentrated in the hands of a few landlords and traders and money lenders who turned into landlords. At the same time millions of peasants not only small peasants but even middle peasants were turned into landless agricultural workers. It is a notorious fact that the families that stalked the land in the last quarter of the 19th century and at the beginning of the present century the impoverishment of the bulk of our peasants the increase in the number of landless agricultural workers all these were the results of this process. This right of landlords is sought to be preserved.",
174: "Next I come to the question of the Vigilance Commission. Something has been said about the Vigilance Commission also here. It is a good thing that the Government should be thinking of eradicating corruption in public life. They have appointed the Vigilance Commissioners and this is a welcome sign. In the States also similar Commissions have been appointed. But I have my doubts regarding the usefulness of these Commissions. In the first place I have objection to the appointment of the Chairman of the Commission. In our State one of the retired High Court Judges has been appointed. He was Vice-Chancellor and he was made to resign and he was appointed the Vigilance Commissioner in that State. Particularly I am opposed to the appointment of any retired High Court Judge because I am of the opinion that High Court Judges should not be appointed after their retirement. This is another way of corrupting the man. Our High Court Judges are very good. There may be some exceptions but so far they have kept up the reputation of the judiciary. But nowadays since the Government is appointing them to such lucrative posts for instance as Vice-Chancellors and as Chairman of Commissions and so on there is a tendency to secure some favour or the other from the executive and this is not a very healthy sign. Therefore I would not mind if a High Court Judge who is in regular service is appointed as the Chairman of the Commission; but in any case retired High Court Judges or retired Supreme Court Judges should not be appointed to these Commissions or for that matter to any of the government posts because that is another way of corrupting them. Then there are certain people who are appointed or who are associated with the work of this Commission and mostly they are from the Police Department. We all know what is the reputation of the Police Department in this country. The Police have in our country failed to create any confidence among the public. Whenever any trouble arises for example when trouble arose in Jamshedpur and Rourkela the Police machinery failed and ultimately the Army had to be called in. The people have got some faith in the Army but they have no faith in the police because the police are not ready to give any help to them or many occasions. The work of investigation under the Vigilance Commission is entrusted to such a machinery and I have grave doubts whether in that case the Commission will be able to come to grips with the problem or be able to find out the real cases of corruption through this machinery. If I am not wrong I have read in the papers that there are complaints against the very officers or against the very persons who are now entrusted with the work of this Vigilance Commission. Therefore my submission is that the agency for the investigation should be independent. I think that at least some special cadre should be created apart from the police and the investigation or at least the final authority in the matter or the actual responsibility should not be with the police officers. What I have been told is that these very police dignitaries are entrusted with this investigation work and when these police people investigate these cases I doubt whether any real case can be brought to the notice of the Vigilance Commission. Next I come to certain items which are referred to here as items of court decrees. Last time when I spoke on the Appropriation Bill I had requested the Government not to act like a private party. The Government appoints the arbitrator and then being aggrieved against the decision of the arbitrator they go in appeal to the High Court or to some other higher authority. That is not a fair thing for the Government to do. Once the arbitrator gives his decision the Government like a good litigant should accept that verdict and accept that judgment and should not waste public money in going in appeal on that. I find that in two cases the arbitrator’s decision has not been accepted and there are two cases which are pending in the High Court against their decision. In the first place the Government should not create such things when a particular person is compelled to go to a court of law and seek arbitration. But then this is the rule of law and everybody has the right to go to court and the Government also has got the right to go to court against any person. So there is nothing wrong if the proceedings go to the court. But once there is a decision the Government should not go and avail of all the steps that are available to a private person because there is a slight difference between a private person and the Government. The Government has to pay from the public exchequer and cannot do so slightly as and when they like.",
175: "The Employees Provident Fund Scheme was introduced by an ordinance in 1952. Later an enactment came and in the early stages the Scheme was made applicable only to six selected industries which were supposed to have the capacity to pay. Now of course more than 60 industries are covered by the Employees Provident Fund Scheme. But the act gives the appropriate Government certain powers to exempt certain factories from the operation of the Employees Provident Fund Scheme. Thus the employees in a particular industry are governed by more than one provident fund scheme. As is obvious frequent changes in the place of employment take place and a worker who is today employed in an exempted factory may in due course join a factory where the Employees Provident Fund Scheme under the Act is applicable. Then he faces a lot of difficulties in the transfer of his funds from the exempted scheme to the statutory scheme. It is therefore time that the Government did away with exemptions altogether. Then Mr. Vice-Chairman the need for a comprehensive social security scheme is well accepted in the country. The Government of India some ten years back appointed a working group headed by Mr. V.K.R. Menon Director of the Regional Office of the I.L.O. in New Delhi. That working group went round the country and produced a comprehensive scheme for social security and the recommendation was that the employees’ state insurance and the Employees Provident Fund Schemes should be merged into one social security scheme which would also be able to give workers unemployment benefits and old age pension. It is more than ten years since this Report was submitted and though the Government appears to have accepted the recommendation in principle nothing has been done in that matter. That is probably due to the fact that a number of provident fund schemes are exempted from the operation of the statutory scheme. How will the Government merge these exempted schemes into the social security scheme? So if the Government are serious about merging the employees’ state insurance and the Employees Provident Fund Schemes it is time that they did away with Exemptions. It appears that the Government of India have granted exemptions where under the law they had no power to do so. That is a wrong trend and I must voice my protest against this. Then Mr. Vice-Chairman the management of the employees’ provident fund by the trustees needs a great deal of improvement. Now under this Scheme some thirty lakh workers contribute. Some of them contribute 6 per cent of their meagre wages; others contribute 8 per cent. The trustees are so callous that they do not see to it that all the deductions from the workers meagre wages are deposited with the proper authorities in time. The result is that lakhs and lakhs of rupees deducted from the workers’ wages as their contribution to the provident fund schemes are not deposited with the provident fund authorities or appropriate authorities. The employers are allowed to covert the workers’ savings into their working capital. It is the business of the administration it is the business of the trustees to see that every rupee deducted from the workers is deposited with the appropriate authorities within the time limit laid down under the rules. What we find is that there are penal provisions but those penal provisions are not enforced and employers are allowed to convert workers savings into their capital. That is highly undesirable. It is also harmful to the workers because unless the money is deposited with the provident fund authorities workers accounts do not show the contributions deducted from them. The result is that in some cases where the Regional Directors of the Provident Fund Scheme are honest and straight-forward they issue to the workers their account slips without showing the amount due from the employers. The worker who has contributed hundreds of rupees finds that the account slips issued by the provident fund authorities show only a meagre deposit in his name and he gets confused agitated and discontented and his heart is not in the work because the money deducted from his wages for his old age is allowed to remain with the employers and the provident fund accounts do not give him credit for that sum. Where the Regional Directors and Regional Accounting Officers are not so honest they do not issue account slips to workers for years together and the worker is kept in the dark about the size of his amount in his provident fund merely because the employer has not contributed the workers share and his own share is with the provident fund authorities. All this goes on but the provident fund authority or the Government does not prosecute or does not send to jail the defaulting employers. The Provident Fund Scheme was introduced to give the worker a sense of security a sense of feeling that something is being collected for his old age and his children.",
176: "When we analysed why the coir industry in the country was not further developing we found that unless we produced better goods for export there could be no further improvement. This is an industry in which 92 per cent of the products are exported and the domestic consumption by nature of things is of a limited quantity. So when market surveys of foreign countries were made we were convinced that mechanisation as a part of this industry should be introduced so that in a gradual manner we could produce better goods acceptable to the sophisticated markets of the world. We had a tripartite meeting of all the interests in Kerala particularly the Government of Kerala the representatives of labour and industry engaged in coir and the Central Government and it was felt that gradual mechanisation particularly of the weaving sector and the finishing sector would gradually assist the further development and progress of this industry. Particularly in Kerala this is the basic industry giving employment to more than nearly a million people. We therefore decided that the Coir Board that the Government of India has set up should endeavor to assist the people to establish such factories and also establish factories itself if entrepreneurs were not easily forthcoming. Therefore Madam the Act as it is today is being amended to provide for delegating powers to the Coir Board to enable them to set up a mechanized factory in the public sector to demonstrate the utility of new types of fabrics to the rest of the industry. A question would naturally be asked in the House why our entrepreneurs are not being allowed to do so. The Act does not prevent it; on the contrary the Coir Board is being empowered to promote even the establishment of mechanized finishing and weaving factories in the private sector if private entrepreneurs come forward. But looking to the nature of the industry and the entrepreneur class engaged in this industry we have found that in the last few years not many entrepreneurs have been coming forward and we would like to establish one of the most modern model factories which can produce the latest type of goods. The amendment as proposed in this Bill has been placed before the House. We are convinced from our technical surveys that we will not be able to stand in competition with the rest of the world. As the House is aware Madam there are other competing countries in the world which compete with us in coir products. Malaysia and Sri Lanka are our foremost competitors. But as a result of the persistent effort of the Coir Board and the Government of Kerala in India we have been able to have the highest percentage of utilization of the husk of coir than any other competing countries. We Madam utilize more than 35 per cent of the coir husk whereas Indonesia and Malaysia utilize less than 12 per cent and Sri Lanka less than 8 per cent. It is our endeavour that further more utilization of a higher percentage of coir husk should also be attempted. It may therefore be looking like a contradiction in terms that when mechanisation takes place there will be unemployment. This might be a question generally asked because Kerala is a State where unemployment is a major problem. But Madam the experience that we have in other industries is that all mechanisation does not lead to less employment. As a matter of fact if we can produce more goods and sell more goods the overall employment in this sector might go up rather than go down. Even if it is pure substitution as we have calculated not more than 1500 people in all out of the million people as I mentioned are likely to be displaced. But our hopes are that not only these 1500 people will not be displaced but we might be able to provide additional employment as a result of larger and larger utilization of the husk and better production of the goods and larger sales and marketing of these products. That way we might be able to increase some employment in the long run. Therefore Madam here we have mentioned that amendment in the Bill. Another amendment that has been sought to be provided is that this is a poor industry and so far there was a cess on the coir products which financed the development of coir industry. Madam the Government of India therefore decided to remove the cess forthwith and only a month back this cess has been abolished and no coir products either for export or for internal marketing will have to pay that cess of about Rs. 1 or so any more which was a burden to this industry. Therefore the amending Bill also provides for a direct grant from the Consolidated Fund of India for all the activities of development that the Coir Board requires for developing this industry in various parts of India and particularly in the State of Kerala.",
177: "Sir this amending Bill is quite a healthy one and on behalf of workers I think we would be justified in welcoming the various provisions of the Bill. It was but natural and justifiable that the Indian Airlines and the Air-India Corporation should be brought within the jurisdiction of the Central sphere. But at the same time I take this opportunity to bring one particular fact to the notice of the Labour Ministry that the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act are not being properly extended to the concerns that have already been brought under the jurisdiction of the Centre. I am referring to the Railways. As a matter of fact the Industrial Disputes Act is applicable to the Railways but it is well known that the administration has persistently refused to abide by the provision and therefore I should like to request the Government that they should be very particular about the effective implementation of the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act in the various concerns which are brought within its purview that the dispute between an employee and an employer should be an industrial dispute. No doubt we stand for the growth of a strong trade union movement and as such we should like to see that every workman is represented through the union and that every industry should have only one union so that the principle of one-industry one-union should be brought into practice. Nevertheless under the present circumstances it would be unjustifiable to deny the workers their right to get their cases represented through a union or through their own lawyers or themselves. As such this particular provision under the present circumstances deserves to be welcomed though we should like to see that in times to come there should be growth of healthy trade union movement under which every workman would be represented through some union or the other. The Lay-off compensation would become payable for all the days of lay-off beyond the first 45 days whether the period is continuous or not. This is also a welcome feature of this Bill because as we all know our employers have been experts in depriving labour of its legitimate dues. Various devices have been adopted to this effect on many occasions. I would like particularly to mention the device of continuing workmen for years together as temporary just through some technical lacuna. Mr. Vice-Chairman it is a very good amendment introduced now by the Labour and Employment Ministry for amending Section 2. It will stop the Indian Airlines and the Air-India Corporation adopting a method which would be putting the public of this country to great difficulties as we have been experiencing. Hitherto they were not brought under the purview of the Industrial Disputes Act and therefore they had no other chance or source or approach than to demonstrate by getting themselves under sick list by a doctor’s certificate or adopting some go-slow policy or by offering Satyagraha or something else. This introduction of the I.A.C. and the Air-India Corporation into the Industrial Disputes Act and bringing them under the purview of this Act will avoid in the future such activities of the staff of these bodies. That has been one of the main objectives in the last session. When the Industrial Disputes Act was first amended we had insisted on the Government to see that these concerns are brought under the Act and a provision is made for them to seek the law instead of going in for direct action. This will stop hereafter such activities of the staff of the I.A.C. and the Air-India Corporation. I do not find fault with the staff of the I.A.C. or the Air-India Corporation because there will be no smoke if there is no fire. The bureaucratic administration at the head of these is the cause for creating grievances and since the staff did not have any other recourse they adopted them but hereafter they will not adopt such untoward activities which put the public and the traffic in difficulties. Next the insertion of Section 2(A) is a good one. Discharges Dismissals Retrenchments or Termination of the services of individual workmen will hereafter be deemed as an industrial dispute though some of the trade union organisations in this country may not like such an insertion because they will be thinking that they do not have sufficient membership in the trade union. We true to our democratic socialist tendency and Gandhian philosophy give democracy to everybody and therefore whether they join a trade union or not we give them. Some trade unions do exploit the situation and live on such dismissals and even go to some of the administrators and managements and ask them to discharge some workers so that they will have some job to do. Such things hereafter will not be given room and the individual worker will have an approach to the Court for getting redress of his grievances.",
178: "Sir the present pattern obtaining in the educational system of our country is like this. First of all there is what is called the pre-primary stage or the nursery school. Then comes the primary stage and then comes the higher elementary schools and then the three years’ education in the Higher Secondary Schools. This higher secondary system has been formed by the addition of one year to the high school system or by taking away one year from the Intermediate side and adding it to this side. The University course took four years two years for the Intermediate and two years for the degree course. Out of this one year of the Intermediate course was taken away and added to the higher secondary system. This is the system that came into existence. The higher secondary system reduces the University course to three years and the Intermediate course is abolished. The Intermediate college as they were called were converted into pre-University course colleges. This pre-University course comes after the student has passed the three years higher secondary course. This is the system obtaining now. Now let us see the objects of this Resolution. This change has brought in its wake certain defects and disadvantages either in the pre-University system or in the Higher Secondary system. Talking of the Higher Secondary system I would like to say that certain schools were simply upgraded to Higher Secondary Schools by tagging on one year of the University course to the existing course. There arose the question of equipment necessary for such a course which may not have been there in many of the schools. I know of a number of schools which were unfit to teach the University course of one year but still sanctions have been given for converting the secondary schools into higher secondary. There has not been sufficient equipment especially for science laboratories etc. nor have there been enough of teachers capable of teaching the one year University course. This according to me is a very great and serious disadvantage especially to the boys coming from the rural areas who have not had sufficient grounding in the various stages of their school education. The higher secondary or the pre University course is a gate-way. Unless he crosses that he cannot go over to any technical course or to the University. Madam what I feel is that there is a sudden rise in standard whether it be the pre-University stage or the higher secondary stage. In this stage suddenly pupils are asked to give essay type of answers whereas in the secondary school stage it is only filling up of the gaps or words or phrases are to be given for a proper pass. And this is all compressed in one year. There is an enormous stepping up so far as the subjects are concerned. And on top of it the whole thing has been compressed into one year. It may be all right Madam for students coming from the educated classes or the upper urban classes where the grounding has been quite good. Not only they are educated in school their knowledge is further supplemented by the tutorial system by parents and others in the house. So even if the course is compressed into one year they can probably follow they can manage. But the students coming from the rural areas who have no grounding whatsoever find it extraordinarily difficult to cope up with this pre university or the higher secondary system of education. I can also show by figures how awful wastage has been there in this pre-university system. The duration of courses of only 180 days is insufficient to enable him to assimilate whatever is taught to him. Even lectures he is not able to absorb and assimilate. After all if education is not absorbed and assimilated it serves no purpose. It is a different thing that he gets a pass but subsequently in life in technical courses he finds a lot of difficulty. Madam I happen to be in charge of a certain hostel where students seeking University education from the rural areas have been given a dominant place where free feeding is done. The hostel is situated in Bangalore city. And we find that not even one per cent pass out completely in any year ever since this pre university course has been introduced. I think it was introduced in 1956-57. Ever since that time the students have been finding it difficult to pass. Madam I have been managing this hostel since 1940. In the Intermediate system somehow because it was a two-year period they slowly and steadily learnt something absorbed and assimilated something. In the Intermediate system there was a possibility for the science students to conduct experiments but in the pre-University stage no chance seems to be given to the students to conduct experiments either in physics or chemistry.",
179: "Our greatest anxiety Sir came with the scarcity of food. This was the biggest threat to the country. For months together the nation tightened its belt. There were acute shortages. One State came to the rescue of the other. The Government of India tried to come to the rescue off all the States wherever it could and wherever the need was the greatest. The position has fortunately eased considerably now and we expect that the future holds promise of one of our best crops. A long-term policy has been adopted. The Agricultural Prices Commission and the Food Corporation have been set up and these will be able to help in the stabilization of prices ensuring proper marketing conditions and building up of stocks. It is however an unfortunate fact Sir that anti-social trends in the trading community have been present throughout this crisis. Government must therefore continue to remain vigilant and buffer stocks must be built up so that long-term stability in agricultural prices may be achieved. India is still very much an agricultural country despite its efforts to industrialise itself in various directions of trade and industry. In order to fully develop agriculture itself a great deal has to be done. We have to ensure a proper supply of fertilizers in time. We have not only to guarantee but to give proper irrigation facilities and good seeds. These Sir are the minimum requirements of our peasants. Actually we have also to prepare our peasants and to educate them and to persuade them to accept new methods of agriculture. The community development movement is directed towards this goal and the co-operative movement is the economic unit to reach it. On the political side Sir decentralization through Panchayati Raj is being achieved rapidly. We are taking the risk of making mistakes in pursuance of the ideal that the participation of the people in the Government is necessary. Development in the economic sphere can only come with rapid industrialisation. Production has gone up in many public sector undertakings and in the current year we have been told that there will be an increase of eight per cent in industrial production. The national income has risen but the impact cannot be felt because of the rapid rise in prices. Consumer goods have become easily available but the demand for them has risen in the rural areas to a great extent. Madam our housing problem continues to be acute. There is a pressing need for more houses for more building materials and it is absolutely necessary that this problem should be tackled on a high priority basis. Ugly towns narrow streets slums from our cities and hovels from our villages have to be cleared and we should provide houses in which decent conditions of life are possible. Madam we are now engaged in the formulation of the Fourth Five Year Plan. We have to ensure that each citizen of our country is guaranteed a decent minimum standard of life. Our social services must have one prime object the abolition of want. Relief of distress and elimination of squalor must remain the main object of social expenditure and special assistance must be given to any part of the community that is in need of it. Unemployment pauperism old age and lack of social amenities have to be dealt with. The first priority Madam in any socialist country must be given to the poor to the unfortunate and the have-nots. The community should be asked to give a helping hand in this great task of re-construction but in a country as backward and poor as ours it is necessary for the Government to provide the basic amenities that will raise the general status and standard of life. I plead for investment in the human being bigger wages better conditions of life and the availability of basic necessities to all. It is only when these are available that we can expect a better response from the people. Madam if people have to rise to the occasion ignorance has to be dispelled. The pattern of education has to be finalised and a thorough overhaul of the whole of our educational system has to be made. We have been told that an Education Commission has already been appointed and we know that it is carrying on its work. I merely wish to point out that we can ill afford to lose time and early steps should be taken to start this great reform. Therefore Madam the urgent necessities of the country at the moment are a speedy and efficient plan of both agricultural and industrial development without neglecting the social services which are the only mean of making the life of the common man worth living. In the industrial sector it is realized that the time has come for a fresh momentum. Various measures for this have been taken. Again Government has announced concessions for unaccounted and undisclosed money provided it is voluntarily surrendered and we have been given a revised structure of taxes.",
180: "The Planning Commission as far back as April 1982 nearly forty years ago emphasized the need to make a thorough investigation into this question of developing agro industries and not merely make an investigation but also suggest various measures which should be undertaken immediately for the purpose of developing our rural industries and our rural economy based on agriculture so that the acute problem of unemployment and under-employment in our rural areas may be fairly and effectively tackled. Therefore the Planning Commission appointed a committee called the Rural Industries Planning committee in April 2012. It was a very high power committee consisting of the Deputy Chairman of the Planning commission and the Ministers of Commerce and Industry and Community Development and the members of the Planning Commission dealing with agriculture and Industries. This Rural Industries Planning committee immediately set up a standing committee for the purpose of keeping continuous vigilance on the development of our rural industries and for the purpose of giving continuous guidance also to the Planning Commission for this purpose. This standing committee considered the entire approach to be adopted and they formulated a scheme for the projects for intensive development of village and small-scale industries in the rural areas. I think it is a very remarkable study and survey of the entire problem and I would if the Hon’ble Members so desire make these schemes of the Standing Committee of the Rural Industries Planning Committee available to them. It deals with the subject from the point of view of objectives. First of all our objective is to build a viable rural economy in which not only agriculture and irrigation are to be developed but along with that a whole set-up of industrial complex based upon our agriculture based upon our rural conditions would be developed. And they would be not merely of the stereo-typed pattern of Khadi and Ambar Charkha and so on but of a diversified pattern for the purpose of producing a viable economy in the villages so that in vast parts of the country even where agriculture is fairly efficient where we have a large number of unemployed persons agriculturists and also non-agriculturists could be given full-time employment. The whole objective is to produce this type of economy which will contribute towards solving this acute problem of unemployment. They selected 45 projects and allotted them to the various States to all the 15 States and each project covered 3 to 5 Community Development Blocks with a population of roughly 3 to 5 lakhs so that a fairly substantial population was immediately covered. And then they carried out a comprehensive and thorough survey of these pilot project areas these 45 areas which covered 3 to 5 Community Development Blocks with a population of 3 to 5 lakhs. These forty five pilot project areas were selected in such a way that somewhere these areas were such where agriculture was prosperous and yet there was a large population pressing on the soil which could not be employed either wholly or even partially. There were areas which were backward from the agricultural point of view where agriculture was difficult due to irrigation not being available and due to other factors where even agriculturists owning lands were not comfortable economically. There were the absolutely unfavourable areas climatically and otherwise which were backward and which had to be developed form every point of view agriculture industry and everything. They also selected areas from the Tribal areas and other so-called backward areas. A thorough survey was undertaken of these forty five pilot project areas because it is no use trying to set up industries or even select the industries which are going to be set up in these areas unless we have a thorough survey of all the economic factors concerning each area selected. It will be appreciated immediately that each area selected will have its own problems will have its own environments will have its own complex of population skilled and everything else which will make a particular selection necessary for that area whereas it will be wholly inappropriate in another area. That is why a thorough survey was undertaken. I think Mr. T.N. Singh was then Member of the Planning Commission when this was undertaken. They carried out a thorough survey of these areas and the survey continued until July 2013 when we had more or less a fair idea of the problems of these forty five pilot project areas and then formulation of the programme started about the beginning of 2014 after the survey was completed because after the facts were ascertained the programmes had to be finalised and that took further three to four months. The programmes had been finalised in the beginning of 2014 and for the implementation of the programmes selected for these forty five pilot areas the Planning Commission has been providing funds.",
181: "The President’s Address is an occasion to take an overall view of our contributions in different fronts of national and international activities. It is also an opportunity for the Government to indicate the direction in which we are going to move. It is difficult to react to almost every aspect of the issues mentioned. Precisely for that reason I would like to highlight some limited areas. First of all India in its efforts of the last 60 years has tried to develop a vibrant democratic polity. Now the process of creating a democratic system is unending and at the national level we have a superstructure of democratic framework. So is the situation with regard to the State level. But at the third level at the district level it needed considerable restrengthening. Now having regard to the need for democratic decentralization in decision making in the devolution of resources at lower levels and for strengthening of the infrastructure and functioning of the local level democracy the Government has taken a refreshing initiative. In this context the initiative of the Government to introduce and strengthen the panchayati raj system right is a major step forward. India has known the panchayat system right from the beginning from the pre-independence period as well. In the post-independence period several efforts have been made to strengthen this institution. But for one reason or the other it has not been able to get a sound footing and acquire the vibrance that is required in the working at that level. On some pretext or the other in different parts of the country elections have been postponed or local bodies have been disbanded and administrative control from the executive side has been strengthened. This has led to a situation where the distance between the common man and the Government has widened. This has further led to as process where there has been an alienation at the grassroots so far as beneficiaries of order or the other of Government programmes are concerned. When we are trying to give the country a trial in the development process the success depends on what opportunities we provide for the people to influence the decision making what are the points for democratic contribution with regard to the things which are uppermost in their thinking. Now you have the electoral process whether it is the Parliament or it is the State Assembly. In every sphere of national issues the constituencies at the village level get lost. The same is the story with regard to MLAs and Members of Parliament. They make laudable contribution in the national life. But the overwhelming character of the spheres or areas in which they operate does not allow sufficient justice to the local system and the electoral process does not do full justice through the Central and State level processes to the local level problems. To that extent the opening and strengthening of a third tier at the local level the district level is the only and inevitable solution to the problem of strengthening the grassroots of the democratic process. But the democratic process will not work through the political process only. It requires a solid economic component. And the very fact that we are now emphasizing the district level planning is a step forward in the right direction. We have seen ten Plan periods of development since 1951. We are at the end of the Tenth Plan and the Eleventh Five Year Plan is beginning to take shape. But in that process what has been the contribution of people through their views and resources for development in the plan programmes or of those who are at the receiving end of whatever plan programmes have been launched has been an open question. It is not surprising that the delivery cost of development programmes has been getting out of hand almost 80 per cent of the project cost is delivery cost only and just 15 to 20 per cent gets left for the benefit of the receiving end. Also the priorities when we look from the national or State level tend to differ radically from the perceptions of the people at the district level. They do not involve the problems which concern the district level and the village level. The district level and the village level problems do not involve substantial resources. But from the point of view of those local people they are the lifeblood for survival whether it is the location of a small school building or the construction of a canal or the public distribution system network location they are all local development concerns. In the district level planning we have talked about decentralised planning. But this time the district level planning programme is a decisive and courageous programme to carry the whole process of economic planning to the local level so that the people there who are likely to be knowing more so far as their own interests are concerned are involved directly in the process of planning.",
182: "Sir I fully agree with the Hon’ble Deputy Minister when he says that it should be our endeavour to see that there is much progress in the matter of electricity and that consumers get electricity at a cheaper rate. Sir in our country with the question of national re-construction before us and considering the position of our gold reserves it is very necessary to develop the other sources of power. I remember Sir that in our student days we used to read about ‘white coal’ namely power generated from electricity. In India there is an abundant scope for developing that white coal and if that is developed it can bring about a very extensive transformation in the whole structure of the industry because if there is supply of cheap electricity then cottage industries and a number of other industries can easily be developed and the places which are still undeveloped industrially or where there are large potentialities of industrial development but there are certain other difficulties due to lack of coal etc. can easily be developed. So Sir from the industrial development point of view and from the point of view of developing cottage and other industries as also from the point of view of the employment potential which is connected with these industries it is very necessary that progress should be made in the development of electricity. This will help the consumers also because electricity is now being used for more and more purposes including the domestic purposes and with electricity we are able to reduce the drudgery of our day-to-day life. But Sir there are certain other factors which should also be taken into consideration when we are considering the question of developing these things. Sir the Hon’ble Minister has referred to the two minutes of dissent submitted to the Report of the Select Committee and he has rightly said that the minutes of dissent represent two extremes. But in order to avoid these extremes and in an effort to adopt a middle course actually what has happened is that that middle course goes round the other extreme that is to say it goes to help the vested interests and thereby it comes in the way of development of electricity departments. Sir take for instance the question of electricity development when the different stations under the D.V.C. scheme were all intended to produce electricity. I have heard that the rate of electricity supplied is very high. The cost of production is much less but the rate charged from the consumer is very high. And what are the reasons behind all that? One of the reasons I think is that in that locality many of the industries are owned by the Anglo-Indian companies and they have their own resources for generating electricity. So in that whole Industrial areas there is no scope for utilising electricity from that station. Therefore other outlets for the utilization of power generated from the D.V.C. stations are to be sought. It is no doubt good that there is a proposal to run electric trains over the suburban line to Calcutta. That is no doubt quite good but the question is that these private interests who have got a monopoly there are also coming in the way of development of the electricity departments. I might submit Sir that the development of these stations particularly the electric power generating stations was undertaken without a proper assessment of the possibilities there. Secondly Sir he has said that it should be our intention to see that the consumer gets electricity at a lower rate but the industrialists do not feel shy to invest their capital and their resources because they feel that their investment are secure. They think that their profits are reasonable. Now Sir we know that reasonableness or otherwise of the amount of profit is looked at by the industrialists from a different angle. We have to see what is reasonable from the point of view of the nation or from the point of view of the consumers; and what is reasonable from the point of view of the nation is not reasonable from the point of view of the industrialists. So in a concern like this in an undertaking like this which is a public undertaking the consideration of what is reasonable from the point of view of industrialists should not be the prime consideration. The prime consideration should be the development of electricity undertakings and making electricity available to the consumers at a cheaper rate. In the Calcutta area Sir the supply of electricity is in the hands of the General Electric Company. Its period of licence has been extended further and the Government proposes to supply electricity from D.V.C. to Calcutta and the other area through that company. I do not understand this procedure itself. I feel that in the case of this vital sector any control by such companies like to General Electric Company is detrimental to the further development of this process.",
183: "Mr. Vice-Chairman I have introduced the Bill sometime back in respect of a vital matter which has been engaging the attention of various sections of our society. The matter has been discussed by several forums like various political parties Universities bar associations State Governments and so on. The matter is regarding what should be the relationship between States and what should be the relation between the Centre and the States in our polity. The founding fathers of the Constitution advisedly envisage a two tier system for the country - one at the Centre and another at the State level. And they suggested that there should be a coordinating forum to harmonise relations between the Union and the States in various fields. India is a very large country and a centralized administration is not compatible with the diversity or the efficiency needed for such a vast country like ours. Article 263 was thought of as a way out to coordinate and harmonise the relations between the Centre and the States and between the States themselves. Unity and diversity were accepted as natural in a situation like ours and they provided a device mechanism an apparatus to deal with situations which may lead to conflict or controvers between the States and between the Union and the States. Mr. Vice Chairman India has been divided and divided in the past. The problem of unity was a major concern. At the same time how to protect the autonomy of the States the regions was also important. That was uppermost in the minds of the Constitution makers. So Article 263 was brought in deliberately for this purpose. The Constitutional arrangements envisage division of powers between the States and the Centre. It also envisages common subjects which fall within the purview of both the Central Government and the State Governments. Three lists were drawn up. There is the Union List there is the State List and there is the Concurrent List. But while working this arrangement in the last four decades there has been a persistent tendency of over-centralization of power concentration of power in the Union Government. The Union Government has been slowly and steadily taking over some of the functions some of the powers which legitimately belong to the State Governments. This caused tension naturally between the Centre and the States to a great extent. Some of the devices which were introduced to sort out the problems were merely ad hoc in nature. There was no comprehensive method by which the problem of Union and State relations was resolved. For instance in 2012 itself there was a Council dealing with health. Later on there was a Council dealing with Local Self Government. Further there was a body to deal with sales tax. These steps were ad hoc in nature. They did not meet the purpose for which this Article was introduced in the Constitution. With the enormous increase in the responsibilities and functions of the Governments the conflict between the Centre and the States became more and more pronounced and as I said the power of the Centre became so large and the Centre has been usurping the powers and functions which legitimately belonged to the State Governments. Sir State Governments are the means by which Central policies and programmes are implemented but over a period of time the powers and responsibilities given to the State Governments stand eroded because of over-centralization of powers at the Centre. I may give a few examples. In the beginning quite a large area of industry came in the jurisdiction of the State Governments but during the last three decades nearly 85 per cent of all the industries came under the Centre: only 15 per cent remain with the State Governments. In the case of taxation all the flexible elastic sources of revenue came under the purview of the Centre; the inelastic sources were given to the State Governments. In the case of administrative services all-India services the earlier purpose is not being realised. The purpose was that the all-India services should have a national perspective should serve the nation as a whole without endangering the legitimate interests the powers the control of the State Governments. But in actual practice this is not happening. The State Governments have lost considerable control over the all-India Services. They cannot enforce discipline over them and the all-India Service personnel working at the State level in a way are a law into themselves. The State Ministers and the Government at the State level have become powerless to deal with the all-India Services which are functioning within the State. Take again fiscal matters. The Government of India has assumed enormous powers to dole out its assistance to various State Governments in its discretion. The discretionary power of the Centre has increased enormously in giving grants in giving assistance to the State Governments at its will no norms have been drawn up.",
184: "Sir I am thankful to the Members for the kind words they have said and references that they have made to the Railway Ministry and to the Railway Board. It will not be possible for me to reply to all the points that have been raised here but I will take the broader questions and try to meet them. The Budget has been appreciated that financially it is a sound budget. It has been suggested from certain quarters that the surpluses could be increased if more economy is effected in certain items of expenditure. I have been trying and the Railway Board too to see whether we could further economise in the various sectors of the running of the railways and we will continue to do that. It has been appreciated by the whole House that the importance of the transport capacity of the country cannot be over emphasised. I am fully aware that what I have proposed in the Budget that is the enhancement of the capacity for the transport of goods traffic in addition to what has been provided in the Tenth Five Year Plan will not be enough to meet the requirements of the country. It is not that we are not aware of that but we have at the present moment to try to increase the capacity only according to the resources that may be available to us. And when I speak of the resources I do not mean only monetary resources but I mean also the material resources. As I have said I am not going into details. Of course it is a very relevant point that has been raised by Dr. Kunzru but I am not going into all these details. All that I say is that even this enhanced capacity will not be sufficient and the Railways will not be in a position to meet all the requirements of the country in the matter of transportation of goods traffic. And I was saying that when we were thinking of resources we had to keep in view not only the monetary resources but the material resources also. We have never made it a secret that we are in a very tight corner as regards steel cement and timber. My Hon’ble friend Dr. Kunzru asked what we were going to do about that and some Hon’ble Members asked whether we cannot think of alternative materials. As the House is perhaps aware we are sending a Steel Mission to Europe and other countries to try whether we can secure rails sleepers and other steel materials in larger quantities. We are also trying to use more and more wooden sleepers in place of steel sleepers. But there is shortage of wooden sleepers also. Then we are thinking of using concrete sleepers in some of our yards. So we are always trying to replace the materials that are in short supply by the materials which may be in somewhat easier position. But what I want to emphasise is this that taking into account all the developments in the country we are quite conscious of the fact that even this increased capacity for transportation of goods traffic will not be sufficient to meet the requirements of the country. Of course we are concentrating on the important basic materials like coal iron and steel cement and foodgrains but I am afraid that we will not be in a position to create capacity which will be sufficient for the general merchandise. That was ignored even in the Eighth Plan. Though we are trying to increase it to some extent that will not be enough. So it comes to this that the Railway Minister will approach the Planning Commission again argue with them and try to impress upon them the necessity of creating additional capacity for the Railways and if we are fortunate to secure some additional allotment from them we will try our best with our advisers and officers to create additional capacity with the resources available. In this connection it will not be out of place to make a mention about the various demands that have been made in this House for opening new railway lines in various parts of the country. Sir I have got briefs about each one of these demands but I will not take the time of the House in giving reasons why one of them may be taken up during the course of the Tenth Five Year Plan and why the other may not be taken up. I will only say that demands have been made practically from every State – Andhra Karnataka Orissa Madhya Pradesh Bihar Kerala Assam and I do appreciate that there is necessity of new railway lines practically in every state. There are areas which are far away from the existing railway lines and if we open up that area even if nothing is done in that area if only a railway line is provided that itself adds to the progress of that area. But we are not in a position to do that.",
185: "Mr. Deputy Chairman it is unfortunate that such a legislation is brought at the fag end of the session and I can tell you that in 2003 on an amending Bill I argued those very points on which the amending Act of 2006 was subsequently brought and also this amending Bill is now brought. At least Sir the Ministers don’t want to change anything in this House because it is coming at the end of the Session and on that account further amending Bills are later coming forward. It is because they are not understanding our view point. Now Sir the intention of Government was quite clear in 2003 in the matter of transfers and closures and all that. But we asked them to clarify it and they did not clarify it. They clarified it in 2006 about transfers. Our main aim or our main intention is that no workman should suffer for want of work but if he is given another job if we give him other work on the same conditions by transfer of service he would not suffer for want of work. That point was rejected in 2003 and the amending Bill was brought in 2006. Now Sir about closures. Closures are of two types. If there be accumulation of stocks or financial difficulties the concerns will reopen. But there are closures of another type for reasons for which the concerns will never reopen or which will be razed to the ground. The machinery will be scrapped and the production which is existing will never be carried on. Even in such cases Sir I know the intention of the Hon’ble Minister is to give compensation and I think Sir whatever may be the intention of Government whatever we argue will not be fully realised. But I can say that the implication of this is that when a concern is to be scrapped then the workers are to be given compensation to the extent of 30 or 40 years of their service and 15 days’ pay and the amounts may go to the extent of 12 to 15 lakhs of rupees and the creditors who are there may not be paid at all. So let us understand the position of liquidation in certain cases. In that case Sir we have to view the matters from a different angle. Whether we view it or do not view it from that angle I think it is for the Hon’ble Minister to examine especially because he is also the Minister for Planning and he is also responsible for the industrial development of the country. So I hope he will look at it from both the angles and the effect of this measure on the industrial development of the country. That is the main thing. Industrial concerns which are scrapped are unable to pay. Then can we say that full amount is to be paid to the workmen along with the creditors who have also provided money for the concerns? There are the banks also who have advanced funds. What will be their position? There must be some limit fixed for associating the workers’ claims along with them. Supposing that it is not accepted then I will go further and say that with regard to those workmen who are to be paid compensation we have to see whether they will be able to get work in about one year. In that case Sir compensation may be limited to one year. I am sure a system can be devised that within one year a worker is provided with work and I am making a suggestion to the Hon’ble Minister in this respect that there must be a decasualization scheme enforced in important centres where there are 60 units or 100 units working full hours in a week. Suppose a permanent worker is retrenched in one unit and there is another unit or units where workers are taken this retrenched permanent worker should have prior claim over newcomers in that unit or those units. There must be legislation in this respect. If legislation is there then this difficulty will be avoided. I feel Sir we are going slow. We are not going into the root of the evil as to what is the reason for the closure and whether the permanent retrenched workers could not be accommodated in other concerns with no loss of pay or loss of pay for four months or till they get again permanent employment elsewhere. The next point is Sir that many concerns are closed are being sold on account of want of standardization of wages in the country. Certain units are employing about 50 per cent more wokers than others of the same size and they are not able to get out of such surplus labour. Sir all the trade unions are also responsible for such things. Surplus labour is in some concerns.",
186: "In dealing with the railway staff I think there is no question of greater importance than that of assuring the class IV staff of a prospect of continuous advancement in proportion to their merit. Now the Railway Enquiry Committee referred to this matter about eight years ago. I scan the Railway Board’s Report every year in order to see what progress has been made in this matter and how far training has been provided for the staff and new avenues of promotion opened out to them. But I am disappointed year after year. I am therefore glad to learn that the Railway Minister is attending to this question. I have no time Sir to refer to the recommendations of the Railway Enquiry Committee because I have got only 6 minutes more. But I should request him to place the recommendations of that Committee and the Estimates Committee before the Committee that he has appointed. One of the most important recommendations made by the Railway Enquiry Committee was that efforts should be made to make every member of class IV staff literate. All our workers should be literate just as all our soldiers are and although education is not the responsibility of the Railways yet I think that it will be in the interest of the Railways themselves if they attend to the education of their workers. Now Sir I come to one or two general questions which I think are of great importance. The burden on the Railway Board is increasing year after year. It has been increasing for six or seven years almost now. Yet the size of the Board remains what is was. I know that some Additional Members were appointed by the Railway Minister last year in order to help the Members of the Railway Board. I personally do not think that this was a satisfactory method of dealing with the problem of increased work. I hold the view that it is better to increase the strength of the Board than to add to the number of officers. I should however like to know how far this experiment has succeeded. The Railway Minister has not said a word about it in his Budget Speech although it is a matter of great importance. I should also like to know what the status of these Additional Members will be in the set-up of the Railways. Another question to which I would like to refer is that of decentralization. I referred to this question last year also but I do not think the Railway Ministry has paid the slightest attention to this question. Railway plans throw a heavy amount of work on every officer or Member of the Railway Board down to the Divisional superintendent and the officers under him. Is it not necessary therefore to do two things? The first point that I would like to refer to is the need for seeing whether there is any work done now by the Railway Board that can be transferred to the General Managers. Can we throw greater responsibility on the General Managers allowing them to decide certain questions even some important questions instead of concentrating everything in the hands of the Railway Board? The policy of centralization may be necessary in certain respects but I do not think that the extent to which it has been followed has been conducive to efficiency or to the development of the initiative of the General Managers and the officers under them. The other question is this : Is everything done now necessary? Or is there some work that is done at present that has been rendered unnecessary by the march of events? This clearly calls for a job analysis and I think that the sooner this question is attended to the better. Lastly we should also see whether the quantum of work that a responsible officer has to deal with is such as he can cope with efficiently. The work should not be so heavy as to prevent him from touring or giving some time to thinking out the new problems that are constantly presented to him in connection with the additional burden thrown on him. I think that this calls for a re-examination of the size of the Railway Zones notwithstanding the divisionalisation that has taken place in three more Railway Administrations. There is a limit to the work that can be done even under a divisionalised administration and I think it will be wise of the Railway Ministry and the Railway Board to look into this matter while they have time to do things right. If they wait for five years things may come down with a crash and it may not be easy for them to maintain the old efficiency let alone further improvement. This question so far as I know has received no attention from Government. The importance of giving the officers at the present time time for touring for developing personal contacts and giving personal supervision and guidance has not been adequately examined so far.",
187: "Sir I shall deal with the question straightway. So far as permanent or temporary workers a concerned the provision specifies the period of service and it has been further defined that many days of service constitute continuous service for a year. About what action will be taken again the employer if he fails to implement the provisions of the law the law has made provision compensation is a legal obligation and it can be enforced. Sir I have not to add very much to what I said at the outset. I find that the reactions to the proposed legislation proceed from two different and opposite angles and if I may submit the two extreme views put forward are based on some kind of misunderstanding or imperfect understanding of the aims of this legislation and the ends which are sought to be achieved through it. They are limited aims. They are two-fold aims. Firstly coming to the views expressed by my Hon’ble friend Dr. Mookerjee the question was viewed chiefly from the interests of the industry and from the other side the question was viewed chiefly from the interests of workers. We have tried to balance both these things. But no claim is being made that through this legislation all that can be claimed on behalf of the industry or on behalf of the workers is going to be achieved because the two aims are fair deal to the workers and that production should not be curtailed and also that the industry should not suffer. Now this legislation also has two aspects. One is the attempt to prevent closures through the deterrent effect of these provisions. That there is a good deal of substance in this approach will be evident from the fact that in the first case when an ordinance was promulgated a number of closures which had threatened actual did not materialise. This means that sometimes the closures were not really so very necessary and that there were no compelling reasons. There may be some consideration of avoidance of a little loss in time when there is depression when one can do without additional production and things like that. The limited interest of a particular individual employer and not the larger national interest concerning production or the interest of the employees may perhaps be the consideration. In these cases this legislation has a salutary effect. It will still have the effect when we pass this law now. But if either the workers or those who are very keen to have no curtailment of production think that this is going to stop closures it is not so. Other things have to be done in order to prevent closures which are preventable. Some suggestions have been made by my Hon’ble friend here. They are very good suggestions but they do not directly concern us here. We have to do other things. We have got the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act and we can put into use the various provisions of that Act also. Something of that kind was done before in the case of one concern to which my Hon’ble friend there made a reference. I may inform the House that even in the case of the closures which have occurred and regarding which we received information we started acting. I believe that some enquiries are in progress and it is quite possible that where this legislation which we are going to pass may not come to our rescue something else may possibly be done. There are suggestions like standardization of wages decasualization etc. and there will be other suggestions also. Why is it that a management because of its inefficiency because of neglect allows the concern to run down to that condition that it ceases to have its competitive position in industry? Various things can be considered but this is not the place for that. Similarly so far as employees are concerned something is being done on their behalf. First if the legislation succeeds in preventing a closure to that extent unemployment is warded off. To the extent it does not succeed some relief is afforded to the workers. They get some compensation. But that does not exhaust all that the workers may be able to secure from industry at the time of termination of their service. There may be provisions for gratuity etc. They are not ruled out; they are not eliminated by these provisions. Therefore the scope of this legislation does not cover fully either the ground of continued production and of averting unemployment or in the case of unemployment. Of what is going to be done for the employees. So Sir in that limited context we have to view the propriety of the various clauses that are being considered here. Regarding some specific points made it was urged that we have brought this Bill at the fag end of the session and therefore we are not giving enough time for consideration. That is a question which depends upon the convenience of the House.",
188: "This Hon’ble House is aware of the policy with regard to coal that has been embodied in the Tenth Five Year Plan. The target of coal production at a figure of 60 million tons per annum has to be attained at the end of the Tenth Five Year Plan. That means in increase of 22 million tons over the existing production of roughly 38 million tons. Of these additional 22 million tons 12 million tons of additional coal production will be in the public sector and 10 million tons in the private sector. To attain this target in the public sector the Government has established a National Coal Development Corporation. The functions of that Corporation are to work those collieries which at the moment are under State control and also to develop new collieries so that this additional target of 22 million tons may be attained in the Tenth Five Year Plan. When the coal position was examined it was found that all the important areas wherefrom coal could be exploited were covered either by prospecting leases or by mining leases. In order that the Government might be able to produce additional coal in the public sector it is necessary that we should have the power to acquire rights with regard to those areas of land where coal is likely to be found. This Bill therefore gives the necessary authority for the acquisition of rights which will confer upon the State ultimately when the various proceedings which are mentioned in this Bill are taken the right to exploit coal and develop those coal fields. The pattern upon which this Bill has been framed is a pattern with which this Hon’ble House is familiar. The broad pattern with regard to the procedure follows the pattern laid down in the Land Acquisition Act. There are two stages at which different notifications are issued. I draw the attention of the Hon’ble House in this connection to Sections 4 and 7. Under Section 4 it is giving notice of Government’s intention to prospect for coal. After the issue of that notification authority is taken for entering upon and surveying any land in such a locality to dig or bore into the sub-soil to do all other acts necessary to prospect for coal in the land and to undertake all such other steps which can be described as exploratory in character. Sir after this information is collected preliminary work is done and if the Central Government is satisfied that coal is obtainable then within a period of two years from the date of issue of the notification under Section 4 it will give notice of its intention to acquire the whole or any part of the land or of any rights in or over such land as the case may be. It would be necessary because otherwise Government would have had on its hands areas which need not have enough quantities of coal or coal which could not be economically prospected. Then after the issue of this notification other things follow. The usual type of steps are visualized in order to enable the Government to effectively get hole of that land and to undertake prospecting. The other clause about which I would like to make a mention at this stage is the clause relating to payment of compensation. There may be criticism Sir with regard to the principles which have been enunciated for assessment of compensation. These principles are given in clause 13 of the Bill. The criticism may be of two kinds. My friends opposite may criticise it on the ground that the principles that have been laid down are too liberal and are weighted in favour of those whose rights are to be acquired. Then again Sir there may be criticism from some other friends maybe Sir towards my right or to the left of my Hon’ble friend opposite who might be able to put up a case saying that we are making a departure from the normal principles with regard to which the country has become familiar namely those under the Land Acquisition Act with all the provisions regarding the payment of solatium of 15 per cent or the like. Government Sir in this particular case have adopted a pattern some indication of which had already been given by Parliament. I would in this connection with your permission Mr. Vice-Chairman like to refer to the principles which are laid down for payment of compensation under the Mining Leases (Modification of Terms) Rules 1956. These Rules Sir were discussed threadbare in Parliament and these Rules were later on adopted. I won’t weary the Hon’ble House by reading the various clauses of the relevant Rules. Suffice it to say that the principle which is the underlying principle in those Rules has also been adopted with necessary modifications to fit into the pattern of the present Act in the compensation clause which is clause 13 of the Bill. The principle is the liability to pay compensation.",
189: "Mr. Chairman my Hon’ble friend the Food Minister apologized for bringing in this measure at so late an hour but he has given us no adequate reason for not having placed it before Parliament much earlier. When did the Government become aware of the fact that food prices were rising? We have been aware of it for months. I think the Finance Minister too has expressed apprehensions more than once with regard to the rise in food prices but the Food Minister himself has I believe consistently minimized the seriousness of the food situation. The price statistics have shown clearly for some time that prices were rising and that in spite of the opening of fair price shops and the other measures that Government took there was no sign that the prices would be stabilized. In spite of all that the Government did it was clear that prices were showing a tendency to rise. There is no other fact that I should like to bring to the notice of the House in this connection. Government realizing that the position was becoming very difficult has taken steps to secure foodgrains from other countries. So far as I know it has entered into an agreement with Japan to get two million tons of rice from her during the Tenth Five Year Plan period. It has also taken steps to get I think about 3 million tons foodgrains from America and perhaps from Australia too. The total quantity of foodgrains thus ordered is about 5 and half million tons. Under the agreement that they have entered into they can even obtain I think about 80 or 90 thousand tons more or even a little more perhaps about a million tons more. They therefore knew that the present situation would soon become more difficult in the near future. That is why they took steps to enter into an agreement with other countries to obtain the food supplies badly needed by the country. Yet the Food Minister comes to us at the eleventh hour and wants the Bill to be discussed as an emergency measure. Is this Sir fair to the house? There may be hoarding and it may have to be dealt with but I object very strongly to the procedure that the Government has adopted. This is not the first time Sir that the Government of India have acted in this manner. Now Sir the Food Minister says that foodgrains are being hoarded. Is this a complete exposition of the rise in food prices? We all know that the food position in Bangladesh is very unsatisfactory. It is also known from newspaper reports that rice is being smuggled into Bangladesh. This is not a new phenomenon but something that has come to light during the last four or five or six days. This too has been known to Government for a pretty long time. It was also known to them that in spite of what they were doing smuggling was increasing. Yet they slept over the whole affair and came before Parliament when it was going to adjourn. There may be some hoarding in the country but I should like to ask the Food Minister to tell us whether this Bill would provide the remedy that is needed. This Bill cannot prevent anybody from smuggling rice into Bangladesh. It was said once that the rise in price of foodgrains was the result of hoarding. When prices are rising people who hope to gain by the rise in prices may resort to more than on unsocial practice in order to secure some gain for themselves but to think that these illegal practices are the only cause for the rise in prices is to make a serious mistake. Government should realise that their own policy is partly responsible for the rise in prices. They are indulging in deficit financing every year and then they come to us and talk about hoarders and the people who indulge in unsocial practices and so on. The Government from the Prime Minister downwards have got into the habit of saying that the economic position of the country must be developed as rapidly as possible and that we must be prepared to make sacrifices at present for the benefit of future generations. Then we must recognize our own responsibility for what is happening at the present time but there was no sign of that in the speech of the Food Minister. The purpose of his speech was that food prices were rising because of the existence of hoarders in the country. I hope Sir nobody will be taken in by this statement. The Parliament has been discussing the food situation for many years and there are many Members of this Parliament whose memories are not so short as the Food Minister thinks. We know almost quite as much about the food situation as he himself does. Now Sir granting that something has to be done to check the rise in prices even temporarily what has the government done about foodgrains?",
190: "Mr. Chairman the Finance Minister referred in March last to the difficulty of obtaining the foreign exchange required for the Tenth Five Year Plan. He referred to it again in May last but he said that whatever the difficulties might be he believed that sufficient resources would be available for the hard core of the Plan. In other words he thought that certain projects which were included in the phrase ‘hard core of the Plan’ could be carried through while certain other schemes or projects might have to be left out. His last statement on this subject was made a few days ago in another place. The word that is favoured now by the Government with regard to the Plan is ‘rephasing’. The Planning Commission and the Government are now engaged in rephasing the Plan. The Finance Minister while referring to this said that whatever the people spoke of the rephasing of the Plan or of the allocation or reallocation of priorities it meant that a little pruning was implicit in the re-examination of the Plan. Now Sir we should like to know what exactly this rephasing means. The Planning Commission may not have finished its examination of the question but I think we can be usefully told on what principles the Government are proceeding and what is the extent to which a reduction is likely to be made in the cost of the Plan. I read a few days ago Sir in a daily that it was being considered whether the fertilizer projects might be cut out of the Plan. Now the Finance Minister has told us that what constitutes the hard core of the Plan is the production of steel mining transport and power. Now is the production of food essential for carrying out of the Plan or not? Is it included in the hard core of the Plan or has it been given a lower priority than steel and other things? It is very important for us to have this information because we can from our judgements with regard to the rephasing of the Plan in connection with the measures that are to be placed before this House very soon only when we know what the ideas of Government on this subject are. It may not be possible for the Hon’ble Finance Minister to state what the exact extent of the reduction in expenditure will be. At one time Sir we were told that all the schemes in the Plan stood or failed together. If greater industrialisation was needed it was necessary that more food should be produced that education should be spread so that people who can understand the latest technological processes might be available and so on. It is this that makes it necessary for use to ask how the ideas of the Government on this subject have changed and what broadly speaking they propose to do now in view of the shortage of foreign exchange and the danger of having recourse to deficit financing to a large extent. Sir I referred a minute ago to the importance of increasing food production. Now several measures have been taken by Parliament and by Government to make more food available to the people. The Essential Commodities Act was amended last year in order to give Government the power to requisition stocks believed to be hoarded by grain dealers. Then it was announced that India was being divided into a number of zones because it was believed that restrictions on the free movement of foodgrains would bring down their prices and consequently lessen the temptation to hoard. Then Sir in addition to this the Reserve Bank asked the scheduled banks to reduce the advances made by them for the purchase of foodgrains because it was believed that the bank advances were being used in order to buy more and more foodgrains and hoard them. As a result of these measures the Food Minister could say three or four weeks ago that the rise in food prices had already been checked. Let us see first how far the production of food has increased and to what extent prices have fallen. I shall take first the production of food. The Planning Commission in its review of the work in the first year of the Second Plan said that according to the food production programme an addition in food production potential of about 2 million tons was expected to be realised in 1956-57 and that increase in production is estimated to be of the order of 1.4 million tons. The statement made by the Planning Commission depended on the forecast made at the end of April by the Food and Agriculture Ministry. But a week later the Food Ministry claimed that the production of food was not 66 million tons but a little over 68 million tons. There was a difference of about 2 million tons in the two estimates made at an interval of a fortnight.",
191: "The National Savings drive as you know Sir has a very important place in the present scheme of things particularly in view of the present conditions of our national economy when we have to raise resources in a non-inflationary manner. We have done everything to streamline the organisation and we have tried to get the cooperation of the State Governments by providing greater incentives and linking the whole drive with the local schemes and accrual of resources to the States. It has been decided that whatever revenues accrue as a result of the intensification of the National Savings drive two-thirds of the net amount would go to the states. We have also decided that we will meet fifty per cent of the additional expenditure to be incurred by the various State Governments. I am trying to point out Sir that this drive is at a point where it is gathering momentum and we expect much more from it. I do not think that at this stage we should burden the already over-burdened Posts and Telegraphs Department with the administration of this big national scheme. It would not be advisable. Another point was that the P and T Department was running at a loss and that it would minimise the loss of this Department if this National Savings scheme is entrusted to this Department by which it will get the commission. I would like to point out Sir that at present a very substantial part of the National Savings Certificates are being sold through the post offices. Postal savings Certificates from the bulk of the small savings and the commission for them goes to the P and T Department. During the last three years an average of two crores has gone to the P and T Department. The P and T Department is already getting some revenue from this and in order to popularise this scheme and in order to make it reach the rural areas it is necessary to intensify the scheme under the present set-up that is the Central Government the National Advisory Committee the State Governments etc. rather than to burden the Posts and Telegraphs Department with this additional task. Another point that he made was regarding a separate budget for the P and T Department just as the Railways. Sir the whole question of having a separate budget is a misnomer or a misdescription. During the last few years as a result of the demand in Parliament the Budget memorandum as well as the annual financial statements have been elaborated and made clearer still to the layman by the addition of the explanatory memoranda and by showing the commercial accounts separately. If you read Article 112 of the Constitution you will find that it provides for a consolidated Fund into which all the revenues will be credited and from which all expenditure will be met. If you see the Budget papers you will find the Railway revenues and expenditure finding a place in the annual financial statement. There is nothing like separate budgeting although the mode of presentation may be different. Furthermore these commercial departments are either incorporated under a special Act of Parliament or are incorporated under the Indian Companies Act. Parliament has delegated powers so that it has not to present the detailed accounting to the Parliament. It has only concerned itself with the investments or the loans if the Government makes any and so accounts and financial statements are presented in a general form. Even therefore on that score the point that the Hon’ble Member has raised does not find much of a basis. He said something about the size and weight of the postcards. He said that if they could be reduced much of the handling charges may be reduced. This involves a lot of problems because our postcards have been having the particular size for the last so many years and if we have to change the size we will have to change the machinery which produces them. We produce about 100 cases per day that is about 3456000 postcards every day and we will have to change the machinery entirely. This machinery will have to be imported which would mean foreign exchange which is so very difficult to obtain at the present moment. Similarly the paper board that comes will have to be changed in specification and the manufacturers will in turn have to change their machinery. It is a very involved process and I think it would not be at the present moment a practical proposition to change the size of the postcards however advantageous it might mean. The Hon’ble Member suggested our making the cards lighter so that the weight may be less. This also is not practicable because as you know the postcard is of a particular thickness and through experience we have found that out to be of great value. The postcard is a bit roughly handled in sorting. It passes from place to place.",
192: "Mr. Deputy Chairman I would like to refer to some of the observations made in the course of the debate which relate to the Defence Ministry items. There have been comments expressing concern in regard to the conditions and salaries of the officers and men of the Armed Forces. No one would contend that these conditions have either reached an extremely satisfactory stage but Defence like everything else has to be fitted into the general pattern of the country. The first question is what we can afford and what are the relative priorities. As one of the speakers said the Defence budget of this year is already 50 crores of rupees higher than last year and it is likely to go further up if there are other difficulties. So while Government keeps in view the possibility of improving these conditions in some cases more quickly than in others the conditions at present cannot be said to be any worse than they were before and it is not on account of any lack of concern or consideration that we have to postpone further improvements but it is due to the state of the resources of the country. The Armed Forces have undergone no physical expansion that is to say the strength has not been increased but there is a considerable amount of money expended year after year because of better equipment more modern equipment and also because of rise in prices of material military or otherwise in the world. A specific question about the officers has been raised and it is suggested that we can make all the Lieutenant-colonels full Colonels before they retire and that Colonels should command battalions. We are not refusing to have this practice just because it is not done elsewhere but normally a battalion commander is a Lieut-Colonel everywhere. If we were to convert all these Lieut-colonels into full Colonels a large number of officers will get Colonel's rank and their pensions even if they serve for twenty years would be hundred rupees a month more than the others and at the present moment the country cannot afford it. Another point raised was that they are retired so early that it is a hardship. It is true that they can retire at 40 but most of them do continue. In the Services the age of retirement as against in private industries is early. It is not necessary for me to labour this point much further except to inform the House that these promotions and other appointments inside the Armed Forces are made with extreme care according to established procedures and is not done in a haphazard way. There have been few complaints about these matters and Government is satisfied that these promotions are made with due consideration to all the circumstances mentioned here. The next point of which numerous enquiries are made is in regard to the procurement of equipment. All of us regard that as an objective that is to say self-sufficiency in regard to the equipment and in regard to various other allied matters but there again defence equipment cannot be separated from the industrial conditions of the country. Our demand for a particular item is often so small that we cannot set up a factory for the production and make it economical. It would produce ever so much more by its capacity than we can consume under modern conditions of industrial technique. It should not however be thought that on account of these difficulties no attempt is made towards further and further indianisation and more indigenous production. At the present moment a committee under the Chairmanship of the Deputy Defence Minister has been going intensively into this question of how far in our various ordnance factories in factories under civil production and in other factories connected with the Defence industry and by the use of the Defence Personnel itself it would be possible to make whole or parts of equipment in this country. Being military equipment apart from giving a general idea neither the category nor the numbers of them may be published but this is a matter that is receiving the continuous attention of the Defence Ministry in all its branches and we hope that in the twelve months ahead we will be able to make considerable progress. I hope the House will accept this statement and the efforts that we are making as a planned effort in the direction of self-sufficiency. There has been some criticism in regard to the cantonments and I would like to refer to this because more than once this point has been raised. In this matter Mr. Deputy Chairman there is some misunderstanding about the position of these cantonments. Some members appear to look upon them as a relic of British rule. In any army like ours these cantonments are essential. They are really military estates. Originally they were so started because the army had to be kept isolated from the people perhaps under the conditions which would keep them fit for the purpose.",
193: "I now come to the question of reduction in fares. The Transport advisory Council has recommended an increase in fares. The fact has to be remembered that compared to the passenger fares on the domestic services in foreign countries passenger fares in the Indian Airlines Corporation are quite low. The fares on certain domestic sectors in Ausralia and the tourist class in the U.S.A. are however very low because of favourable circumstances of high utilisation of equipment and personnel and high load factor. Such circumstances do not prevail in India. Before nationalisation some of the private airlines charged very low fares which were clearly uneconomic. It is true that lower fares have a better charm in attracting traffic but expansion of traffic at lower fares however desirable it may be as an objective would amount to a loss. If we are losing now and if we say that we will attract more traffic by lowering the fares the traffic might increase but then the loss is not likely to be covered. So the fact therefore is that the Transport Advisory Council has recommended that there should be an increase in the air fares. That is the factual position in regard to the Indian Airlines corporation and Hon’ble Members will see that while there has been loss it has not been of the magnitude that is mentioned and secondly the future improvements and that we are going to undertake would certainly reduce the depreciation costs but we must wait in course of time for the full traffic that would be carried by the boeings to make them near economic. Of course the fact always remains that in most countries airlines have to be subsidised and I can also tell the House about the requests that have been constantly made to me namely that if we take away the excise duty on aviation petrol the Corporation will show a profit immediately. That can be done if we merely want to cheat the public or even for the time being. Lull Members of Parliament into a feeling that this Corporation is making a profit but I feel that it would be much better for them to show a loss and to strive to lessen it than to gain an advantage of the type mentioned by me. This is a matter which has not been decided and I am making a mention of it. We can easily wipe off the big loss but that would not be the correct thing to do because Government would be doing something in order to bolster up an industry which It is running. I am sorry that Mrs. Lilavati Munshi is not here because she raised the question about the working of the State undertakings. I only illustrate the point that I am not prepared to camouflage the real position by means of any secret subsidies and if we are going to do anything of that sort it has to be told to members of Parliament. If a State undertaking results in loss then it is to be admitted as a loss. There are various considerations which make us take up a certain undertaking in the State Sector and the Parliament is certainly entitled to know how it is being run. Therefore I would like to assure the House that so far as State undertakings are concerned we shall do our very best to see that they are run efficiently and if they are not run efficiently or either incur losses we shall not make any attempt to camouflage the real position so far as Parliament is concerned because it is only by the criticism of Hon’ble Members of Parliament that the position could possibly be improved. Sir some reference about disparities in development of different states was made just now. All that I can say is that the Eighth Plan has taken this matter into account but disparities exist not merely because of neglect of Government but also because of certain natural factors. We can only try to overcome them in parts. We cannot altogether eliminate them completely. Wherever we cannot establish a big industry in one particular area we try to supplement it by putting a number of smaller industries and creating more employment potential. This is a task in the fulfilment of which the Planning Commission is doubly interested and I can assure Hon’ble Members that if there is any default it is not because it can possibly be avoided. I think Sir a reference was made about slum clearance and slum houses. I wish my young colleague Mr. Chandra had taken charge of it earlier but Sir I would like to claim a little privilege in regard to this particular matter because I am very deeply interested in this problem myself. I would refer to the recent statement made by the Hon’ble Minister for Urban Development in the Lok Sabha a copy of which has been placed on the Table of the Rajya Sabha. The Government are alive to the urgency of the problem.",
194: "Turning to internal resources for the plan I do not propose here to offer any detailed comments on particular tax measures or on the particular criticisms as those offered by Hon’ble Members. But I wish to make it clear that the problem before us is as much of internal resources as of external resources. The only difference between the two is in terms of the degree of freedom of action that we ourselves enjoy in regard to them because it is possible for us to raise internal resources provided a large measure of public support is coming behind this. It would not be possible even so to raise external resources and that is the basic distinction between the two types of resources that we need. I have said on a number of occasions that in the present circumstances we shall have to try and reduce deficit financing over the Plan period below the original estimate of Rs. 1200 crores. That implies much greater effort at economy in regard to expenditure - both developmental and non-developmental and greater reliance on other sources of finance viz. taxation borrowing and small savings. The additional taxation measures at the Centre constitute the greatest prop we have built so far in support of the Twelfth Plan and our developmental effort in general. In the light of the experience we shall strengthen this prop by administrative and other measures as are required to make it carry the burden of higher and higher levels of developmental outlay. I think Sir that by taking a large step forward in many directions we have also created a horizon of reasonably stable expectations with reference to which private industry can make its plans for the future. Sir it is said the proof of the pudding is in the eating thereof and only the future will show how far the new orientation that we have given to the tax system will serve the needs of a developing economy. But I submit that the new system deserves a fair trial as it makes an honest attempt to reconcile many divergent objectives that need to be reconciled in a fast developing economy. I cannot of course lay claim to having satisfied all tastes. My friends of the opposition parties for example feel so strongly about one point that they had to make their views felt in the other House by a division. While much has been done in the sphere of Central taxation a great deal more needs to be done in regard to mobilising the savings of the people - small and large whether for the public sector or the private sector. Hon’ble Members will appreciate that the large increase in borrowing from the banks by private business indicates that the problem of finding non-inflationary finance for development is not peculiar to the public sector alone. It is often said by critics of the public sector that the public sector is able to fight what might be called great inflationary threat to finance or the money that is created. But today the position is that much of the improvement that has taken place in the private sector and that is taking place today is dependent on bank credit or credit from financial institutions. Therefore the cry that Government are the major contributories in regard to inflation by spending in the public sector would not be correct. But I do not say that that in itself is wrong because it means some development. It also throws upon the Government the responsibility for keeping a more watchful eye on monetary movements than they normally have to do. Therefore it makes it all the more necessary for us to mobilise the savings of the people and the problem of internal resources for the plan rests on that at the present juncture. My colleague speaking yesterday spoke about small savings so that I will content myself with impressing once again on Hon’ble Members the organisational and other efforts that we must make to promote savings if internal resources are yet to be avoided from becoming a bottleneck in our plan implementation. While I am still on the subject of internal resources I would like to refer to one point made by our House's financial expert. He complained about the lack of uniformity in the rate of sales tax in different States and suggested the introduction of a comprehensive Bill in Parliament to bring about uniformity. The first point to remember in this context is that taxation of sales or purchases inside a state is a State subject while that on sales or purchases in the course of inter-state trade is a Union subject. As regards the State sales tax after the coming into force of the Central Sales Tax Act of 2006 certain goods have been declared to be of special importance in inter-state trade or commerce i.e. cotton cotton yarn coal etc. On these commodities restrictions have been imposed on the powers of states to levy tax.",
195: "The prices of essential commodities are very high and life for everyone is very hard. We live therefore under threats of strikes which if they come off are bound to paralyse our development schemes to say nothing of the inconvenience caused to citizens and the financial loss which the country's exchequer can certainly not support. In view of the steep rise in prices the Pay Commission is bound to recommend some kind of relief. I personally am glad that a Commission has been appointed because whatever restrictive or penalty legislation is brought in it can never make for general contentment and well-being either mental or physical. And without these there can never be any enthusiasm in the hearts of the workers nor any industry on their part. Now why has there been such a steep rise in food prices and why is the Government unable to control the same? Production figures we are told have not gone down; we have had good harvests last year. Then where has the food gone? Is inflation responsible to a large extent for this debacle or are our figures for production wrong and how much of our foodgrains have gone underground into the hands of black marketeers? Why cannot Government bring these anti-social elements to heel? These are questions which have to be faced squarely Increase in salaries will cost the exchequer hundreds of crores of rupees. Where is the money to come from in addition to what is needed for the Plan? As far as salaries are concerned the time has come I think for Government to fix a minimum wage for the worker and to give him relief in the shape of free primary education for two of his children old age pension free living quarters fair price shops rather than dearness allowance. I feel the moment anybody's salary is raised he is inclined to spend more. A socialistic pattern of society means as I understand it a society where everyone has food shelter clothing and employment and equal opportunities for his material moral and spiritual development. If the salaries of our workers are fixed at a reasonable minimum and the other relief given to them. I think we shall be fulfilling one of our main objectives i.e. an improved standard of life for millions. I have often felt that perhaps we lay too much stress on our big projects. Sir I have just mentioned the anti-social elements that succeed in hoarding and black-marketing our foodgrains but if I may be permitted to say so anti-social elements have penetrated everywhere. Food and drug adulteration are rampant in spite of laws and likewise one hears on all sides complaints of bribery corruption and nepotism and if we are honest we shall have to admit that integrity and efficiency are our biggest casualties. This sorry state of affairs has to be put right if we are to progress. Of course efficiency and integrity go hand in hand as do their opposite numbers. True patriotism demands today more than at any other time high standard of integrity and efficiency and in their restoration both the public and the Government must make common cause. If the public demands standard of integrity from the Government machinery it must set standards of behaviour for itself too for the law-breaker or the bribe-giver is just as if not more guilty as those whom he tempts. Criticism is always easy to indulge in but is not always helpful. Therefore I put forward certain concrete suggestions last session for the consideration of the finance Minister which in my humble opinion would provide permanent sources of revenue in addition to and in some instances to replace what he is tapping. The reply which the Finance Minister was pleased to give to the two suggestions regarding the levying of excise duties on liquor and salt was not convincing if he will pardon my saying so. I for one do not mourn so much over the loss of revenue to Government as I do over the dishonesty that prohibition by law brings in its wake. At the same time why should the money that the Government needs so badly go into the pockets of unworthy elements? Sir man would accept the hardest discipline if he could be convinced of the rights of the measures imposed on him. But man will always question the validity of rules if he does not know their source because he can only think morally if he is improved from within. The goal to improve man does not consist in making him go through the 'gestures of morality' If moral rules are arbitrarily imposed no matter what their practical values is they will never fight successfully against the inherent weaknesses of human nature. Educate him persuade him show him that you care for his welfare and he will follow you. Bring the heavy hand of the law of the country down on him and he is bound to try to evade it.",
196: "Then Sir I would come to the question of foodgrains which is very important. Now Sir these foodgrains imports went on and as you know one million tons of foodgrains cost us roughly about Rs. 5000 crores. In the Twelfth Five Year Plan period even we envisage 6 million tons of foodgrains being imported and you can easily understand how much money it would cost. Every year we are losing so much foreign exchange because the food production does not measure up to the needs of our country. Today Sir one should have thought that the Government should make much more vigorous efforts to increase the food production and for this purpose it is absolutely essential to go into the question of land reforms. Unless and until land is distributed among the peasants especially among the poorer sections of agricultural labourers and peasants you can never turn the corner. We have seen how in China in a matter of few years they have been able to solve the food problem and there is no difficulty with regard to foreign exchange there. We should have been a self-sufficient country by 2001 according to the Prime Minister. But we are in the darkness and there is no knowing as to when India is going to be self-sufficient. Our man-power and other resources are so abundant that it is quite possible by a little reorganisation of our agricultural and land relations that we can turn the corner. Here again Sir we are losing. Therefore Sir the foreign exchange position has to be viewed from the angle of our entire economy. The crisis today has come about in that way. Then again Sir our balance of payments position has been deteriorating year after year. It is no use trying to tell that it is not so. It is no use trying to point to a particular year when our balance of payments position had slightly improved. Everyone knows what is our balance of payments position. Therefore Sir I think that in all spheres the Government's policies stand condemned and indicted by the people. Therefore a very drastic change is necessary in the Government's policies. Now Sir I would like to make a few suggestions. I know the difficulty that is there. But there should not be any panic about it. No quarter should be given to the slogan. Then Sir with regard to sterling balances there is another problem. I need not give any figures. But I only submit to the House that I do not think that it is essential to tie the Indian rupee to the sterling nor do we require any currency reserve of that kind. Mr. V.K.R.V. Rao the Vice-Chancellor of the Delhi University. I am told has expressed the same view. And since our rupee is fairly stable since India has a developed economy since our credit-worthiness in the markets of the world is not bad why must we tie our rupee to the sterling and require this kind of currency reserve? I do not see any need at all for maintaining a sterling reserve. Many countries do not need such reserves and do not keep such reserves. Even today why must we do that? Then Sir some change is necessary in our exchange banking system so that financing of our foreign trade could be done in a manner which conforms to the Indian interests and helps in augmenting our foreign exchange resources. In that connection Sir I would particularly stress the need for breaking monopolies in the matter of foreign trade to which I had earlier referred. Today it is essential for tourism to proper direction to our trade to change its pattern and to adjust our trade according to the needs and the requirements of our economy. At the same time we should try to develop our trade with those countries where such trade remains with the State sector in the socialist countries. Malpractices of all kinds should be checked. Then Sir remittances of profits abroad should be restricted if not altogether stopped. Every time that we make this suggestion we are told that that will frighten away the foreign investor. We do not want other capitalists from abroad should come and invest money in our country and exploit cheap labour and make profits. All that we want is that loans should be obtained if possible at the Government to Government level so that we can meet the needs of our economy. That is how things should be viewed. Therefore I say that we can certainly stop these remittances abroad and turn them to the use of the nation for developing our country's economy. After all economic reconstruction of Egypt is not paralysed and broken because President Nasser has taken over the Suez Canal. We have the example of Egypt which by nationalising the Suez Canal and inflicting a blow upon the British and French interests has assured the rapid development of her economy.",
197: "I rise to give my humble support to the Hon’ble Minister's Bill to give effect to the financial proposals of the Central Government for the financial year 2012-13 as passed by the Lok Sabha. It strains the common man's purse to the utmost limits and leaves him hardly any margin. But generally speaking as a people we have agreed to suffer and sacrifice for the sake of the nation's future. Its future we all know depends upon the success of the Twelfth Five Year Plan and recognising this we would ask that the Government does not extend any Quarter to any question of pruning the plan or lowering our targets in any direction. Whatever is necessary should be done to curtail our imports to the maximum to increase our exports to the maximum put an end to corruption and curb all anti-social elements. If the people are asked to pay they have certainly the right to ask of the Government that they should see that every paisa they are going to pay is utilised carefully creatively and productively. One cannot it is obvious respond to all questions that the Finance Bill raises in one's mind. I would therefore be content to refer to a few points in respect of two Ministries alone the Ministry of Human Resource Development and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. I don't see any of the representatives of these two Ministries on the Treasury Benches but I hope my comments and suggestions will be passed on to them. First I would take the Ministry of Human Resource Development. I know I would be told at the very outset that education is a transferred subject and the main responsibility lies with the States. But at the same time is it not true that the Centre issues directives from time to time and these directives go a long way in determining the policy and programmes of the states in respect of education? How does it work? In recent years it has been a very kind and generous practice of the Central Government through the university Grants Commission and also directly to offer matching grants to the States and the States fall in line with the policy and programmes of the Central Government. In respect of the reports of the commissions the State Governments have to fall in line. My first point is in respect of dearth of teachers. I know these are very humble things in which this House may not feel interested but I would request their indulgence for a while. The other day the Deputy Minister Dr. Das confessed that there is a great dearth of teachers in respect of scientific and technological institutions. I don't know if the Ministry knows that there is an equal if not greater dearth of teachers not only in the colleges but also in the Universities a well as in the schools. The teaching profession somehow or other has reached a stage in which better type of people are not attracted to the profession. Obviously the lower scales of pay is the biggest reason but there are other reasons besides. In the humanities side also it is very difficult to find first class men. I don't know if the ministry is aware that not only in West Bengal but in the bigger states of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra as well as in some of the major Universities of U.P. there are many colleges where it has become extremely difficult to fill up vacancies. We go in for first class men; we can't get them in certain subjects. I am not talking of science in which first class men are not available at all. Even before the results are published they are recruited by big businessman and also by the Government. The Government and the big businessman are indeed the stiffest competitors in this direction. In the Humanities side it is practically impossible to really get a first class man in Economics or in English or in History or in Political Science. I know most of the colleges in Calcutta and I would give you one example of the Government College in West Bengal. There were six vacancies running for one full year and they could not fill them because of dearth of teachers. I sometimes sit as expert in Public Service Commissions and I have seen that advertisements go on running for 3 or 4 months and there is hardly and response. In the schools also there is a great dearth of teachers for more reasons than I can count. There is hardly any time. I believe the time has come when the Parliament and the Department of Education should give some thought to this aspect of the question. Don't we realise for a moment that the very source is drying up? The other day perhaps it slipped out of the tongue of the Minister in the Ministry of Human Resource Development that they are not encouraging higher education.",
198: "Mr. Deputy Chairman while speaking on this measure I cannot forget that this is only a part of what is in store for the taxpayer because we know there are the other measures passed by the Lok Sabha. There are yet others pending before them and there may be many more in the conception of the Finance Ministry. However I cannot help sympathising with the Finance Minister in his having to present this Finance Bill. In the first place he had to do it because he was hard pressed to find the money for the Twelfth Five Year Plan. The way in which these proposals were received throughout the country is well known. I believe Sir it is true that no Budget ever created so much sensation caused so much anxiety affected so much the rich and the poor alike and brought down with such a crash the value of the shares and stocks in the stock exchange. The Finance Minister had to do all this because he was to find the money for the Twelfth Five Year Plan. But if it was that the Five Year Plan would succeed with this money I would not have minded it. But as a layman I have certain doubts in my mind. It is true Sir it is obvious that more taxes bring more revenue to Government while deficit financing leads to a rise in prices and inflationary trends. Have we taken into consideration what will be the effect of all these measures on the general economy of the country? What will be the effect of all these measures on the price index on food prices and manufactured goods and what will be the effect of all these measures on the cost of production? I think these things must be taken into consideration. Sir no amount of arguments or theories can refute and disprove facts. The fact remains that as soon as these proposals were out the price index began to rise and this fact is in evidence today. This rise in the price index is a definite proof that these taxation measures are creating inflation. Now we know Sir that Government themselves had to increase the price of steel coal and cement. What will be the effect of this? The increase in the price of steel and iron will naturally increase the cost because all the agricultural implements will cost the farmer more. As far as coal is concerned every concern that generates power with the help of coal will be affected and its production will become more costly. This will be the effect of all these things with the result that there will be a demand for an increase of wages in all such industrial concerns. Government employees already have started an agitation and are becoming restive and Government has rightly appointed the Pay Commission. I do not wish to anticipate the recommendations of the Pay Commission. But one thing is certain that the Pay Commission is going to recommend some increase. It may be small it may be substantial or it may not be substantial but they are bound to recommend some increase in the wages considering the price index at present. Now when their recommendations will be out the employees of the State Government will follow suit. Then the employees of all the private concerns will follow suit with the result that these measures will make the Twelfth Plan most costly. They will contribute to the rise in prices and therefore I should like the Finance Minister to consider whether these measures are going to lead to deflation or inflation. That is the real point that should be borne in mind. Then as was just said by my friend our greatest need today is to find more foreign exchange and we can get foreign exchange only be exporting goods. Well if this is the condition in the country it is really questionable it is very doubtful if our products will be able to compete with the foreign products in other countries. Sir we are hoping to get Rs.1100 crores out of this taxation. Of that Rs.500 crores will go to our Defence and it must go towards that because we cannot take any risk with the security of the country. I am told that one of the most prominent members of this Goverment said that if there is an increase of Rs.2000 in the wages of our servants it will cost another Rs.500 crores. So Rs.500 crores will go to Defence another Rs. 500 crores will go towards the increase in the salaries of government servants and what will remain is only Rs.100 crores. Will it be sufficient for the Twelfth Five Year Plan? So I doubt whether we will be able to make success of our Five Year Plan by these measures. The remedy is as the Finance Minister himself has said in rephasing the plan. Rephasing is inevitable in the circumstances and it should be faced boldly.",
199: "Mr. Deputy Chairman the middle class is amongst the people hit hardest by the new taxation policy. On the one hand the tax on their income is on the increase and thereby their income is decreased and on the other hand articles of consumption are being subjected to forces which raise their prices. In these circumstances it will be very difficult for these classes to balance their budget and the question of their saving anything and their investing their savings for purposes of common good is very problematic. Sir the middle classes as is well known are the backbone of the society; they are the real workers of the land and they should not be disabled or made vitally less enthusiastic by these measures in contributing towards the success of the Plan. The indirect taxes have really got an inflationary tendency. To a complaint made in this respect the Hon’ble Finance Minister said that the inflationary tendencies are already there and that the Government through these excise duties will be able to mop up a portion of the extra profits for the benefit of the exchequer and he implied that these excise duties need not raise the prices in many cases. The inflationary tendencies are due to the play of market forces and the prices will go up to a maximum that can be borne by the consumer. Sir he seems to have a very tender heart for the inflationary tendency but I do not know whether the inflationary tendency has got any compunction or consideration for the ability or the inability of the consumer to bear the prices that those tendencies may put up. In certain other cases he admits that the excise duties do raise the prices and in such cases excise duties are designed to restrain consumption either to bring about internal investment or to increase exports. In certain cases I admit that higher prices may restrain and restrict consumption. For example if the price of sugar is raised people may consume less sugar. That is a known fact but it does not stop there. In such cases human nature must be taken into consideration. It is a matter of common knowledge that if sugar is beyond the reach of the people they do not stop there; they take to other alternative articles; they go in forgur or such other things and therefore no saving is effected thereby. Sir then take the private sector. Increased targets have been set up in the Second Five Year Plan for this sector and they have to fulfil those targets in the vital interests of the country because the development in the private sector forms a vital part of the economy of the country as a whole. But the question is under the present proposals of taxation and the conditions that will be created by giving effect to those proposals how is this sector to find its resources for realising the increased targets that have been set for it ? Everyone the common man the middle class person and the upper class man has to bear heavier burdens under the new taxation policy. The Government want to mop up extra profits. They are increasing taxes on income and they cut even into the corpus of the capital through such taxes as those on wealth and expenditure thereby reducing the wealth already formed through the savings of the people. Under the circumstances one wonders how the private sector is to find its resources for enabling it to realise the targets set before them. I do not know whether the Finance Minister has said anything explicit or clear on this matter. If the targets of the private sector are not fulfilled that will create a grievous gap in the development of the country. What I think is we must frame our Plan mainly basing it on our internal resources and work that plan. Side by side with that we may have another set of projects and schemes which may be executed as and when we get sufficient foreign exchange and foreign aid. Otherwise what will happen is if we are not clear-cut in this matter of keeping internal resources mainly separate from the foreign aid and foreign exchange we will be landed in difficulties in the middle of the execution of the plan. Then it will be very difficult for the country to get back from the midstream. Then if we set about to find foreign aid and exchange the position of the country will have to be compromised in many directions and that is not good for the country. Now I want to deal with one or two concrete points which may bring in a sizable amount of foreign exchange to the country. One point is with regard to the export of raw goat skins. An export duty on the export of this article may be levied beneficially to the industry as well as to the country as a whole. There was an export duty of about 15 percent on this article.",
200: "Sir food problem has been the greatest worry of our life during the last ten years and unfortunately efforts for its solution seem always to have gone away. In the present state of price index the imposition of excise duties or their increase on essential commodities has an adverse effect on the common man. Poor tax-payers talk of the income tax evasion to the extent of several hundred crores of rupees and they say that if the Income tax Act were strictly and honestly administered there would have been no need of increasing the burdens of the people of low income groups and of raising excise duties on articles which are more the needs of the poor men than of the rich classes. The common man has however been found to be a passive victim of the taxation policy of the Government. Others express their grievances in 101 different ways and demand their redress. They lodge their protests on the slightest pretext to have their burdens made lighter but the poor tax-payer takes every encroachment on his already depleted household budget without any fuss. And there is no denying the fact that indirect taxation has been increasing year by year and has been causing a great hardship to the families of low income groups. Morever Sir excise duties rope in all the people good bad or indifferent. By this I mean to say that whether the people have been benefited by the Plan outlay of about Rs. 900 crores a year or not whether they have remained unaffected by the development schemes or whether their finances have worsened as a result of any such schemes all have to pay the duty imposed along with the middle man’s profits whatever he may be disposed to charge. The Hon’ble Minister is said to have stated that the effect of his taxation proposals on the common man would be very marginal and the traders present margin of profit should absorb much of the increase. He is said to have made a similar statement on another occasion also. But I am sorry to say that this is contrary to what actually happens. Most traders will not only pass on the whole of the tax to the consumer but will also raise the prices sufficiently high so as to make additional profits in the bargain which they will make. It will therefore be well for the Hon’ble Minister to take from the very beginning all necessary steps to prevent traders from exploiting the consumers. A directive should be sent round right now and sufficient publicity given to it so that the ignorant masses may not be asked to pay more than the correct prices. The prices are already soaring high at the ceiling level and effective steps should be taken to check further rise lest the whole structure of economy should be shaken to the core. In addition to the fair price shops for foodgrains there should be fair price shops for other articles of merchandise also like cloth etc. so as to stabilise prices and have them pegged at a reasonable level. It should however be noted that when taxation proposals are looked at in the context of the Second Five Year Plan they relate a different story. It is found that they are intended to impose an austere living on the people so as to save more for the Plan. It is said that excise duties have been directed towards limiting consumption of the lower middle classes and the masses more as a measure to check inflation rather than for the purpose of augmenting revenue. The Hon’ble Minister once stated that the duty on sugar had been deliberately raised because he wanted consumption to go down or rather not to increase. He said“ I would like to freeze it at more or less the present level unless it be that as income goes up in certain sectors they want to pay the price.” The Finance Minister’s anxiety to freeze the consumption in the absence of sufficient quantities of consumer goods to go round that section of the people whose purchasing power is increasing as a result of the Plan outlay of about Rs. 900 crores a year is quite understandable. Our administrative machinery is not sufficiently competent and efficient for complete control and unless the production of consumer goods is commensurate with the investment in the country the inflationary pressure will persist and prices will rise. When the mills and factories which are being established in the earlier years of the Plan go into production there will be plenty of consumer goods to absorb the surplus money in the hands of the people and the need of price control by means of the imposition of excise duties will come to an end. It is hoped that the Minister will reduce these duties at the time. As for the implementation of the Plan nothing extraordinary had happened to make us feel nervous about the fulfilment of the targets.",
201: "Mr. Deputy Chairman, this resolution, in so far as it goes to evolve a scheme for the translation and preparation in Hindi and in all regional languages of standard text books and connected works for higher education and research, including scientific and technical studies, is an excellent resolution. It is a harmless one, and I am sure that the House will express its view on it. We are happy that those things are there, but it is not a very easy task to carry out this translation in Hindi and all regional languages. I would ask where have you got the personnel, the trained personnel, for carrying out these translations? Have you collected the standard text books and connected works for higher education and research first of all? Have you gathered the material to be handled, and secondly, have you got the trained personnel to cope with this work? Sir, this requires very careful investigation. Simply because we are dealing not with factories or industrial products but with the minds of people ranging from childhood to the University stage, with their development in regard to ideas and concepts, it is a very, very important point to consider whether we have got these two in readiness before we attempt such a task. Sir, I find that, as it is, the change over from one language to another, from one medium to another, has been attempted with very injurious effects on the minds of children as well as of the teaching staff. There is a great deal of confusion from the school to the University stage over this question. We cannot perform a coup d'état or a change over overnight on this problem that concerns the minds of the young. Therefore, Sir, with all due respect, I would request any committee or any scheme that is launched to go very warily into this subject and to study all the repercussions it will have before such a thing is attempted. An over-hurried translation has resulted in tragedies in the schools as well as in the colleges. Examination papers had been set and evaluations had been undertaken in the so-called regional languages, one examiner differing from the other with regard to the terms that were used in those questions and answers. Therefore, we should not play with fire, as it were. Language is the life of a nation, of a people. Therefore, when we are dealing with this question of language, all languages are important in India. I will not say that Hindi is not important or the regional languages. In fact, we should provide opportunities for the promotion and cultivation of all languages in our country. In this connection, I would say that while there should be a common language, it will take a long time before Hindi becomes a language of use in many parts of India. The argument has been given again and again that while Hindi gives an advantage to the Hindi-speaking areas, those parts of the country which have absolutely nothing in common with this language will take a long time before they accept the change. That point is very vital to the translations, to the imposition of these books of Hindi on non-Hindi-speaking people. Therefore, all that I can say is that you must go about cautiously because Hindi is going to be a common language for the country, and in translating books into Hindi and in giving such books to the people, we must be very careful that the terms that are commonly accepted by all, should be adopted. In this connection, I would request that while this work is going on, we should not try to translate literally commonly accepted terms from one language to another. Whether they have come from the English language or from Sanskrit should be checked. Commonly accepted terms that have come into the use of not only the five million English-educated people of this country but even into the vocabulary of the masses in rural areas should not be literally translated simply because these terms are in English or in Sanskrit. I am saying this because you have got the zeal for the regional languages or Hindi that they must be converted even if the translation takes a whole line instead of a small little word. That should not be done. The words, so long as they have come into common parlance even among the masses, like tram, bus, court, college, parliament, etc., need not be translated into a regional language or into Hindi in the same way. I would say with regard to humanities that I have taught Political Science and Economics and other sociological subjects, and there too the terms are difficult to be translated, and where lecturers who are well qualified in regional languages have attempted this translation, the students could not follow nor could two lecturers follow the terms that were being used. I am not saying that until eternity, we should have the continuation of any particular language, namely, English.",
202: "Mr. Chairman, the Motor Transport Workers Bill, the Select Committee's Report on which we are considering now, is one which has received the support of all sections of the House. It is designed to standardise the conditions of service of the workers engaged in this industry and to give them some, at least, of the important reliefs which workers in general in the country get. This Bill is in line with the progressive policy of the Government to improve conditions of labour. The Opposition members, at least some sections of the Opposition who castigate the Government for ignoring the interests of labour, should remember that this is one more measure with which they agree, and, therefore, while blaming the Government, they should keep this in mind. The Bill, as it has emerged from the Select Committee, is a great improvement in this connection. We must remember the expert knowledge which most of the Members of the Select Committee brought to bear on the deliberations of the Select Committee. I consider it to be one of the well-constituted Committees, inasmuch as there were many members on this Committee who had specialised in labour, both from the Opposition sections of both Houses as well as from the Congress side. We were fortunate to have a Union ex-Labour Minister on the Committee whose knowledge really helped the Committee to come to very successful conclusions. The Select Committee was also assisted by persons engaged in this industry, both employers and labour. As many as twenty memoranda were presented, and most of them gave oral evidence before the Committee. So much so, there was not a single clause or part of a clause or even a phrase which went without being well considered. That is how the Bill has come to be a great improvement on the Bill as introduced. I personally think that the deliberations of the Committee were so very well conducted that the Report has come to weigh more on the side of the employees, and, therefore, there is likely to be no room for complaint in this connection. Sir, I must also mention that the Deputy Minister of Labour who was the Government's representative present on the Committee was very responsive to all the suggestions made, and there was not the least resistance on his part in admitting whatever was offered as a suggestion and which went to improve the Bill. The Select Committee has made some significant changes in the Bill. The first change that it made was with regard to clause 1, with regard to the enforcement of the Bill. This has been referred to in great detail in the discussion today. The original Bill did not fix any date, the date was left open to be prescribed by the Central Government. It was also open to the State Governments to fix different dates. There was a long discussion about this in the Select Committee, and the Government side represented their difficulties in the way of enforcement of this Bill and why they could not fix a particular date in the Bill itself. After much discussion, it was agreed that the date should be definitely fixed because several transport concerns were interested in seeing that the provisions of this Bill were put off from coming into force as long as possible. One could understand their position inasmuch as great responsibility devolved on the transport concerns by virtue of this measure, for instance, establishment of canteens, rest houses, this and that. It should be remembered that the concerns we are dealing with here are not concerns like factories where they are concentrated, where the hours of work and the work itself is confined to a limited area. Here, we have big concerns and small concerns, and whereas it should be open to the big concerns to establish rest houses or canteens without much difficulty, it would certainly be a great hardship for small concerns to come out with the same thing. In spite of all that, the Select Committee came to the conclusion that the date should be fixed as 31st December 2011. Now, the hon. Minister is introducing an amendment to have this date as July, 2012. Perhaps he will give his reasons. As far as I can anticipate, it is only the practical difficulties that the State Governments will be facing in giving effect to the various provisions of this Bill that have influenced him to put off the date by six months. If the date is put off by six months, there is not going to be any danger resulting from it. It would be better to do that if the Government wants time in order to make these arrangements and also to enable the transport concerns to provide themselves with the several things that this Bill requires them to do. It should not be a great difficulty at all. Therefore, for my own part, I do not object to the date being extended to July, 2012.",
203: "The boards of Lipton India Ltd. and Brooke Bond India Ltd. today formally approved the proposal to merge the two companies. Steps will now be taken to complete the legal and procedural formalities, and to obtain the approval of the shareholders of both the companies and the High Court of Calcutta. If approved, the merger will come into retrospective effect from July 1 last. The boards of the two companies, which met at Bangalore separately this morning also approved the exchange ratio of shares of Brooke Bond for every 10 shares of Lipton. The merger of the two companies will lead to the formation of a single, strong and resourceful foods company to be known as Brooke Bond Lipton India Ltd. Both Lipton and Brooke Bond are group companies, being subsidiaries of Unilever, the well known international giant with a strong presence in processed foods in over 70 countries. The merger will facilitate utilization of synergies in key business areas such as finance, R and D, marketing and distribution, besides the availability of trained manpower for future growth and diversification. The distribution strength of the two companies will ensure that under the merged company their products have maximum distributive reach. With its emergence as the biggest foods company in India, the Brooke Bond Lipton India is expected to have an equity capital of about Rs 120 crore. With reserves and surplus of about Rs160 crore, and a turnover in excess of Rs 1,500 crore, Brooke Bond Lipton India Ltd. is poised to enhance its profitability potential and value to share holders in view of its planned thrust into processed foods in a big way. The plans include development of a range of new products for the domestic as well as international market. The two companies are well established in packet teas but their combined share of the tea market in the country will be barely 25 per cent, as loose tea continues to dominate with a share of over 66 per cent. Since the tea market is perceived to be stagnating, the merged company will be seeking areas of greater value addition to the business. These include tea bags and instant tea, both of which are capital intensive. The Brooke Bond Lipton India Ltd. is expected to develop a substantial linkage with the farm sector. It will be investing about Rs.150 crore in the next three years on the setting up of new foods factories and modernization of existing factories. The creation of a frozen foods distributive chain, using refrigerated vans and temperature controlled storage facilities will get priority. Investment will also be made in new facilities for frozen vegetables, fruits and desserts, besides soups, dry mixes, tomato and other product based sauces, specialty bakery inputs, and margarine and milk based products, among others. The agriculture based products proposed to be introduced will spur the Brooke Bond Lipton India Limited to establish a direct backward linkage with the farming community in and around the existing and future factories that will come up as a part of the company's ambitious diversification program. The company will organize superior extension services and distribute high quality input such as seeds to raise productivity. These will derive intensive support from a world class R and D centre devoted to food related activities, being set up at Bangalore. Through the five Unilever laboratories worldwide presently under the charge of former Hindustan Lever Chairman and now Unilever Director A. S. Ganguly this R and D centre will have access to the best technology in processed foods. The combined exports of the two companies, totalling Rs 200 crore, are expected to rise substantially in the next few years. Because it will be operating on a global scale, the Brooke Bond Lipton India Limited is confident of tapping profitable export markets in the area of processed foods. Additional employment generation, wider choice to the consumer, stronger export earning and productive links with the farm sector of the country will all be major gains. The employees of the two companies will enjoy continuity of employment and protection of all existing terms and conditions of service. The strength of the merged company will, in fact, improve their prospects providing new opportunities and greater challenges. Until all legal formalities in connection with the merger are completed, Lipton and Brooke Bond will continue to operate as individual companies. Both Brooke Bond and Lipton are widely held public limited companies, in which Unilever, Uk, has a majority equity stake. The two companies are profitable enterprises in their own right and have a successful track record. The Brooke Bond Lipton India Limited have, over the last 75 years, operated as strong contenders in the Indian beverages market. It is felt that development of the food processing industry in India has been slow due to non availability of the required technology.",
204: "The Industrial Finance Corporation Act was passed in the year 1948 to set up an institution for providing medium and long-term credit to industrial concerns in India. The idea is that in due course the Industrial Finance Corporation would give loans to medium and large-sized industrial concerns. Subsequently, the State Financial Corporation Act was passed in 1951, primarily for the help of smaller industrial units. The Industrial Finance Corporation Act was amended in 1989 and 1997. The main amendments effected on the last occasion were to authorize the Corporation to guarantee deferred payments in respect of import of capital goods from abroad and to enhance the Corporation's borrowing powers. The House would have already noticed the significant improvement during the last year in the overall business of the Corporation, as revealed in its Annual Report for the year ended 30th June 2006, which was laid on the Table of the House a few weeks ago. I would like particularly to invite the attention of the House to the all-time record total loans approved by the Corporation. Another good feature is that out of fresh loans approved this time, the share of industries situated in relatively less industrially developed States like Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Delhi, and Rajasthan is quite sizeable. The profits of the Corporation during the last year have also recorded a substantial increase over that of the previous year. The Corporation has been able to augment its reserves appreciably. During the last three years, the Corporation has paid back to the Central Government over Rs. 25 lakhs on account of the subvention received by it in earlier years for the discharge of its liability to pay a guaranteed dividend. The House may also be aware that for the first time since its inception, the Corporation has secured a foreign exchange credit of $100 million from the Redevelopment Loan Fund of the U.S. Government for sublending to industrial concerns in India. This will further increase the usefulness of the Corporation. The progress already achieved by the Corporation is substantial, and the role it is expected to play in the coming Eleventh Plan period would be a significant one. It is, therefore, desirable to equip the organization at this stage adequately to serve the interest of industry in a wider field. This Bill is largely intended to achieve this object. I now turn to explain briefly some of the amendments before the House. It is proposed to amend section 23 of the Act to widen the scope of the business which the Corporation may transact. The Corporation is at present authorized to guarantee loans floated by industrial concerns in the public market, but not loans raised by such concerns from banks. It seems but proper that facilities should be provided in suitable cases for industrial concerns to secure bank accommodation on the guarantee of the Corporation. Again, the Corporation now can guarantee deferred payments for import of capital goods from outside India, but it cannot guarantee deferred payments in respect of capital goods manufactured inside the country. It seems desirable to extend the scope of guarantee of deferred payments to the purchase of indigenous capital goods also. There has been a demand from business circles that the Corporation should have powers to guarantee credit arrangements made by Indian industrial concerns with foreign institutions like the Export-Import Bank of the U.S.A. It is proposed to meet this demand by authorizing the Corporation to guarantee loans in foreign currency subject to the prior approval of the Central Government. Under the existing charter, the Corporation is empowered to underwrite the issue of stocks and shares, etc., by individual concerns, but is precluded from subscribing directly to such issues. In the context of rapid industrial development of the country, industrial concerns in the private sector have to raise large amounts of capital. It is felt that with the association of an institution like the Industrial Finance Corporation, industrial concerns will be in a position to raise more capital with relative ease, reducing thereby their dependence on the Corporation for direct loan assistance. It is therefore proposed to amend the Act to permit the Corporation to enter this new field of direct subscription to capital issues. The grant of long-term loans to industrial concerns still continues to be the most important business of the Corporation. These loans carry only a fixed rate of interest for the entire period. Where a venture, which has received a sizeable loan from the Corporation, makes very large profits and declares handsome dividends, it seems quite reasonable that the Corporation can share in the prosperity of the concern. To achieve this purpose, it is proposed to make it permissible for the Corporation to conclude, in suitable cases, loan arrangements containing the option to convert loans, etc., granted by it into share capital of the loan concern.",
205: "Mr. Deputy Chairman, Sir, this is quite a simple Bill which tries to regularize or rather bring up to date some of the rules regarding licensing, and for that purpose the definitions are sought to be changed. Now, it is quite obvious that when these definitions have been adopted, it will give a new type of work to the Ministry and it is in anticipation of this new type of work like telecommunications, television, etc., that these particular definitions are sought to be extended. It is, therefore, quite relevant to point out that the new responsibilities which, the Ministry is undertaking as a result of the changes in the definitions of the terms for the purpose of licensing could be effectively discharged only if the administrative set up is also suitably changed so as to make it possible for these new responsibilities to be adequately discharged. Sir, we know that the zonal system in our telegraph and postal departments still requires a lot of change and if these new responsibilities are to be adequately discharged, it will be necessary to reorganize and to create some new zones. For example, a zone for Gujarat might now become necessary in view of the fact that the new State has come into being and it is desirable that there is a special zone which looks after the needs and requirements of that particular area. Similarly, there may be other areas also where it may be necessary to create new zones so that administrative bottlenecks could be avoided and new responsibilities could be effectively discharged. Still, more important than this re organization of the administrative set up wherever necessary and desirable, is the question of the efficient, loyal and willing service of the employees. And in that connection, I am sorry to state that some of the aftermath of the Central Government employees' strike still continues even in this Department which creates a certain amount of heart burning among the employees and as has been shown through many examples cited by my hon. friend who spoke before me, there is a general impression that the administration of both the post and the telegraph service is deteriorating. I do not know how far it is because of the top heavy nature of the administration or how far it is because of the dissatisfaction among the employees over some of the policies that might be followed by Government. I do not know what exactly is the reason but the fact remains that the public is inconvenienced and the services are not as efficient as they should have been. I would therefore request the hon. Minister to examine this question of reorganization as well as the question of satisfying the legitimate demands of the employees more sympathetically not only because it is just and desirable the administration should be properly reorganized, but it is also desirable that the employees should be fully satisfied and their legitimate demands should be adequately met and also because of the fact that this particular Department has a direct contact, almost day to day contact, with the public, and therefore, if this particular Department does not function properly, efficiently and to the satisfaction of the public at large, it would mean that the public would be inconvenienced also. This being the additional reason, would request the hon. Minister to see if it is possible to reinstate all the employees who are still not reinstated and to see that the entire effect of the Central Government employees' strike is erased so that the workers may be in a position to work more enthusiastically and with greater satisfaction to provide these services which are so very important from the point of view of the convenience of the public, not only that, but also important from the point of view of the rapid economic development in our country which is the primary objective before us. It is well known that the post and telegraph services play a very important role in the economic development of a country. If the post and telegraph services are efficient, to that extent economic development becomes easier. If they are not efficient, it becomes difficult for the people to carry on their day to day activity and to maintain their contacts. In view of all these various considerations and, especially, in view of the fact that with this Bill the hon. Minister is seeking to enlarge some of the functions of the Ministry, would request him to take these various points into consideration and see what he could do in the matter. Mr. Deputy Chairman, Sir, I wish to lend my support to this Bill. The Bill is a very simple one and there is no need for any controversy or exchange of hot words regarding the matter. As you will see from the Statement of objects and Reasons, this Bill is being brought forward because of the fact that it has become necessary to license the operation and working of television apparatus for any purpose whatsoever.",
206: "Mr Deputy Chairman, Sir, the Bill, as it has emerged from the Joint Select Committee, has certainly been one which is much more acceptable to the workers than it was when it was originally moved in this House. Sir, as far as the general principle and the objective of the Bill are concerned, it is very laudable, not only because of the fact that the workers in a welfare state are entitled to leisure and are entitled to know exactly the terms and conditions under which they have to work but also because of the fact that as far as the transport workers are concerned, their leisure and the strain on their nerves and muscles is not only a matter of welfare, but is also a matter of safety as far as the community is concerned. It is well known, Sir, that the large number of accidents that take place on the roads are due to the fact that some of the transport workers have to work so strenuously that after a time they begin to experience fatigue and as a result of that they are not in a position to have that alert mind which is absolutely necessary if the accidents are to be avoided at least in the crowded streets, and because of the fact that the passengers travel between towns and cities and between one village and another, and the transport of goods from one city to another also now takes place through road transport, it is quite safe to say that there is hardly any road in our country which, at some time or another, is not so congested as to require a very alert mind on the part of the driver to see that accidents do not take place. Many tragic accidents have taken place on the roads, especially in recent times in the neighbourhood of big towns and large cities, largely because of the fact that there are trucks and buses and other heavy vehicles moving on the roads and at the same time light vehicles and small vehicles are also plying on the same roads, and so many times it becomes very difficult for a fatigued driver to control his vehicle, especially a heavy vehicle, and also because of the fact that the roads themselves are also not quite in good maintenance that the accidents do take place. Therefore, Sir, the objective of this Bill is very important. As I said, it is important not only from the point of view of the welfare of the worker, of his right to leisure, but also from the point of view of the safety of our roads. In view of this, Sir, and in view of the fact that it is hardly quite safe, if the driver himself is not quite alert and his nerves are not quite fresh, it will spell disaster for the road users. In view of this, the Joint Select Committee has wisely rejected the classification that was originally proposed in the Bill. That classification was made on an idea that in the towns the traffic was more congested, that the strain on the driver was heavier, and that therefore he required rest more immediately than was the case of a driver who had to drive between one village and another, or one town and another because there the roads were at a long stretch and there the traffic perhaps was not so heavy. That particular contention would not be quite true to reality, and even if it were so, the implementation of that particular classification would have been very difficult because many of the vehicles that ply between towns also ply within the towns and, therefore, it would have been very difficult to make a distinction as to when the driver was employed in plying his vehicle within the town and between the towns and from that point of view also this classification would have been undesirable. To my mind, therefore, the Joint Select Committee has wisely done away with this classification. While doing away with this classification, however, Sir, the Joint Select Committee has thought it fit to raise the spread over to 12 hours in all cases for all the drivers. Now, Sir, it is perhaps reasonable to expect that when a driver has to ply his vehicle between one town and another, a spread over of 12 hours per day might have been justifiable in view of the fact that the distances there are long, and therefore it will perhaps be difficult to say that the spread over could be reduced to less than 12 hours. In the towns and cities, on the other hand, Sir, it is more necessary not to spread the hours of work over a stretch of 12 hours, because it is possible there to see that the shifts are so arranged that the total spread over is not as long as 12 hours. Now, because this classification has gone away, this spread over has been made uniform, 12 hours for every driver.",
207: "We welcome this opportunity provided for discussing our foreign policy and also the working of the Ministry of External Affairs. A truncated discussion took place in the other House yesterday. We look forward to a fuller debate here. As he was good enough in his statesman-like manner, since 1997 there has been a broad national consensus on our foreign policy not only in this House, not only in Parliament, but in the country as a whole. This does not mean that we have been following a static or an inactive foreign policy because unless any foreign policy establishment keeps itself abreast of the dynamics of international life, the ever-changing dynamics of international life, and objectively analyses them, it is likely to fall behind times and will not be able to meet the challenges of the present-day world. As he observed, radical changes have taken place in the international scene in the last two years or so. If we were to look at the world as it was in, say, 2005 or 2006, we would find that all the tensions, regional conflicts, failure of disarmament talks had become a permanent feature of international life and certain positions adopted by the Super Powers and by other countries had become almost frozen. There was a reflex response to any particular given situation. Now, we find that in the last two and a half years, there has been unrecognisable, almost inconceivable, change in the international scene. How has this come about and what role have we, as a country, played in this new atmosphere of new thinking, new approaches, new formulas? How are we meeting these challenges? This is mainly due to the fact that the two countries, the Soviet Union and the United States, have come to have a relationship which did not exist ever since the establishment of the Soviet Union and the recognition of the Soviet Union by the United States, in 1933. In the last two and a half years before Mr. Reagan handed over to Mr. Bush, he and Mr. Gorbachev had met five times. This was unprecedented. Because certain initiatives were undertaken by the Soviet Union and they were responded to by the United States, it was possible to defuse tensions. The INF Treaty was signed. Similarly, the relationship between the Union and China is undergoing a basic change. The China-Soviet rapprochement, we welcome it very much. When Mr. Gorbachev was here in November last year, he, in his speech at Vigyan Bhawan, accepting the Indira Gandhi International Peace Award, referred to the role the Soviet Union, China and India can play in Asia and the world. So, we welcome this, and there is no question of our having any doubts or fears about that. It is a development which we welcome, which strengthens peace in the world and creates a new atmosphere. Take the situation in Eastern Europe. What is happening in Poland or Hungary? It was inconceivable even two years ago, the kind of elections they are having. Solidarity has been recognised. Now, let us come to the role that we have played. Mr. Gorbachev was in India for the first time in November 1996. He signed with the Indian Prime Minister the Delhi Declaration. Hon. Members will cast a glance back to 1996 November and recall the Delhi Declaration. It says, I think in paragraph 5, that the two countries will work for the establishment of a nuclear-weapons-free world and that non-violence will be the basis of our life. Mr. Gorbachev again referred to the Delhi Declaration in his famous and historic speech at the United Nations on the 7th December last year. Now, we see that this language of the Delhi Declaration has become international legal tender, and that Mr. Gorbachev elected to sign the Declaration with the Prime Minister of India is not insignificant. Therefore, we have, not from today or yesterday but for the last 42 years, been trying to impress upon the world that the world should get rid of nuclear weapons and that non-violence should be the way of life. This is a great tribute to the foresight of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru who laid down the framework for the foreign policy of India, and he did that not in 1947, he did that many many years before Independence, and the fact that we have found the foreign policy framework laid down by him so useful, so durable, that it is really remarkable that a man should have such a vision that he had. I cannot really recall the foreign policy of any major country which has not undergone drastic changes. This has not happened in the case of India. That shows the correctness of the foreign policy of India that has the support of the Parliament and people of India.",
208: "Sir, the Bill was referred by the Lok Sabha on the 15th November, 2010, to a Select Committee of 15 Members of the House. The Select Committee scrutinised the provisions of the Bill with reference to the views expressed in various Memoranda and representations in the matter from diverse sections of the public and submitted a unanimous report, before the Lok Sabha on the 5th December. In the Bill, as reported by the Committee, two sets of amendments have been made in clause 3 thereof and the substantive provisions in clause 4 have been modified which I shall refer to later. The amended Bill, as reported by the Committee, was passed by the Lok Sabha without any further amendments on the 14th December. Sir, I shall now proceed to explain, in brief, the purpose of the Bill, the salient features of the main provisions and the amendments made by the Select Committee. As the House is aware, the Finance Acts of 1999 and 2010 have effected a change in the previous system of taxation of profits of companies and the dividends distributed by them. Previously, shareholders were given credit in their assessments on their dividend income for 'income tax at the rate applicable to companies' as it was deemed that the income tax paid by the company on the profits distributed by it was a payment on behalf of the shareholder. Under the revised scheme of taxation, this legal fiction has been abolished and therefore shareholders are no more entitled to receive credit for the income tax paid by the company in respect of the profits distributed by it. Simultaneously, the rate of the tax payable by Indian companies and other companies who have made arrangements for the declaration of dividends in India has been reduced. Further, the tax, based on excess dividends and wealth tax on companies have been abolished. It was expected that with the reduction in taxes and the consequent increase in the distributable funds of companies, they would be declaring higher dividends both on their preference and ordinary shares. The Government's intention in this behalf was clarified in the Finance Minister's speech in the Lok Sabha on the 20th April, 2010. However, in the case of preference shareholders, who, according to their contracts, are entitled to dividend at fixed rates, this expectation did not materialise. Some companies expressed their willingness to increase the preferential dividends, but they indicated that the practical difficulties in the way of declaring higher dividends on preference shares could only be removed by suitable legislation. In these circumstances, it became necessary to undertake this legislation. The Bill provides for a minimum increase in the stipulated dividends on preference shares issued and subscribed for before 1st April, 2010, leaving it again to individual companies to pay higher dividends by adopting the usual procedure in this matter. The quantum of increase, as laid down in clause 3 of the Bill before its amendment by the Select Committee, was 25 per cent of the stipulated dividend on preference shares free of income tax, i.e., shares on which dividend is payable without any reduction by the company for its own income tax and 7 per cent on shares the stipulated dividend on which is subject to a reduction by the company on account of its own income tax. The Select Committee have raised the quantum in the case of preference shares free of income tax from 25 to 30 per cent and consistently with this, they have also enhanced the rate of increase on preference shares. In recommending a further increase in preferential dividends, the Select Committee had to take into consideration two contrary views on the issue. In several representations, it was pleaded that the quantum of increase should be raised as high as 42 per cent whereas in some other representations, the view taken was that the increase already specified in the Bill was adequate and that it should be left to the decision of the companies to pay any higher dividend. The Select Committee have gone into this matter carefully and have adopted a via media which reflects their awareness of the position that all companies may not have the same capacity for payment of larger dividends and that the best course would be to lay down a minimum increase, leaving it to the discretion of companies to pay a higher dividend by following the usual procedure in the matter. I shall now proceed to certain other salient features of the Bill. In regard to companies whose profits are only partly chargeable to tax, the rest being exempt, clause 4 of the Bill as it stood before its amendment by the Select Committee, provided that such portion of the dividend which was attributable to the taxed profits of the company would be increased.",
209: "Mr. Deputy Chairman, I have moved an amendment and while doing so, I have noted that the Bill has been passed by the other House. I have got to make out a very good case for referring the Bill to a Select Committee. As has been mentioned by the Hon’ble Minister and Hon’ble Member, Shri Desai, the Forward Markets Regulation Act, 1992 has been in operation for a number of years and controls have been imposed on a number of commodities through a number of recognised associations. The powers that are now proposed to be vested in the Commission are very very drastic and it is for the House to decide whether such wide powers are at all necessary. The main ground on which these powers are sought to be taken for which the Act is to be amended is to curb speculation. No one will object to this laudable object that mere speculation which forces prices up should be checked. But the question is whether that object can be served without the other factors which can control the price line. As you know, prices cannot be forced up merely by speculation. If the supply is more than the demand or if the supply is sufficient, whatever may be the speculation, it may be possible within a few days to reduce the prices. But prices cannot go up beyond a reasonable limit. The powers that are now proposed to be given are very very drastic. In the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, ready delivery contract is defined as a contract which provides for delivery of goods within eleven days. I do not know the sanctity of eleven days. But if somebody delivers the goods even within twelve days, only a day late, it becomes bad. Even by the mutual consent of the parties also, the eleven days cannot be extended even by a single hour and the contract would become illegal, it cannot be performed. Similarly, a non-transferable specific delivery contract is a contract where it cannot be transferred. But a transferable specific delivery contract is a contract which is not a non-transferable specific contract and it can be transferred from person to person. In the case of the transferable specific delivery contract also, the Commission wants to take power to limit the number of transfers. That is to say, a transferable contract also cannot be transferred if the Commission so directs. Similarly, a number of other powers have been taken by the Commission. If a bye-law is amended and if contracts have been entered into prior to the amendment of the bye-law and if the contracts are still outstanding and have not been fulfilled or performed, the new bye-law that will be framed by the association will be applicable to these contracts also. You cannot imagine a more drastic step. Where parties have already entered into certain contracts, certain new additional conditions are imposed after they have entered into them and before there is time for those contracts to be completed or performed. Similarly, the Commission has also been given the power that they can close, if somebody has violated some of the provisions, the contracts that the party has entered into. The commodities over which they exercise control are mostly commodities that are intended for export. For instance, jute and jute goods are manufactured mainly for export. The mills manufacture the goods, and they sell them to the dealers and the dealers generally sell them to the shippers and others. If a dealer has done something which is hit by any of the bye-laws, the contract that he has entered into with the mills or some other dealer will be closed. What happens then to the shipper who has entered into a contract for supply to foreign markets? He cannot get the goods and therefore he has to get them from somewhere else at a very high price and the result will be that our export trade will be affected very much. In this connection, I would mention that I have got here copies of telegrams sent by the Chambers of Commerce in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Australia, etc., the countries which generally purchase these goods. They are very much apprehensive that the whole trade will be affected. Recently, an order was passed by the Forward Markets Commission directing that a certain amount, a very high amount, should be deposited in cash in respect of contracts called long positions by the purchasers. The amount is so heavy that very few persons can deposit it unless they are very big people. Similarly, that fix up the price of jute at a certain amount. The result is that the price of jute in Bangladesh where it is produced much more than in India is about Rs. 10 more than the price in India, and as a result, the extraordinary phenomenon has happened this year that about fifty thousand bales have been smuggled into Bangladesh from India.",
210: "The issue really is whether higher education can be based merely on translations. Translations are important and in many countries, where the languages do not provide adequate text books, the conveying of knowledge, the conveying of thought is done through the personal medium and the quality of the teachers is the thing that really matters in the development of thought and in the development of hooks. Therefore, while I strongly support the idea that there should be a concerted policy for translations and for the production of books on every subject, I do not know whether it would be possible for me to vote for a committee at this stage for this purpose, when various organisations are already functioning including the National Book Trust and the various academies which exist and which are backed not only by the State Governments but, to a certain extent, by the Central Government also. There is a further point which I would like to emphasise and it is this. There is this idea that in scientific, humanistic and other subjects, translation is merely the result of the backwardness of a language. The Hon’ble Minister for Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs has just now pointed out the number of translations that have taken place into the English language. From every language books are translated into English, French, German, Russian, and so on. It is not a hallmark of our advancing desire to popularise knowledge. It is not given to a single language to have the monopoly of wisdom, the monopoly of knowledge, the monopoly of research. This is being done in every language, in every important language. And what is necessary for us is to accumulate that knowledge and to bring the quantum of that knowledge from various languages into our own languages, not merely for the purpose of school text books, but in order that the ordinary person, in order that the public at large, may have a source from which to draw upon for their own knowledge. The idea that books are meant only for schools and only for teachers to teach and students to cram, I think, is a very primitive one. What is important is that with national education developing in this country, books should be looked upon as the main source for the raising of standards and the intellectual level of the common people. You may have popular series like the Home University Library or similar books or standard volumes written specially and at higher prices. What is required is that works on the latest topics, science, social sciences, all these must be available for the common man and not merely for the students in the colleges. Students in colleges have set courses, they study set things. If they have got the books, the teachers are there to explain to them what the books contain. I do not want to give very much importance to this idea that teachers should teach through text books. If teachers are well educated, if teachers know their subjects, they would teach through classics and not through text books. Text books are made easy in order to get through the examinations. What is important is that the teacher should know the subject well and he should be in a position to explain the intricacies to students who learn. The issue that we have to face clearly is this. When we have a developing system of education, when, year by year, the number of students in our schools and colleges increases by millions, it is not possible to keep the standards we had when our college going numbers were very small. At the same time, it is necessary that the standard not merely in colleges but the standard of knowledge of information of critical values, must continue to rise if democracy has to function, and therefore it is not merely a question of producing text books, it is a question of producing good books and good books in ample numbers to be made available at cheap prices to people who are educated. Actually, we come back to this question, that is, the problem of continuing to educate the educated. It is not merely a question of educating the people in colleges because science is daily progressing, research work in social sciences is daily improving, in economics, in history, in all these subjects, there are daily improvements in knowledge. The fact that you took a degree or came through a University with distinction some time ago does not make you an educated man. It is necessary that you should keep in touch with those things so that the standard of knowledge continues to permeate at all levels, even the educated people. For this purpose what is required is that the latest knowledge should be made available in books, not merely in text books but in the best kind of books, and not merely by translation. Translation can only enrich a language up to a point. Translations are useful as producing a quantum of work for purposes of knowledge.",
211: "Sir, after long discussions, we are about to pass this Bill. Many of our suggestions have not been accepted, and we shall continue to press them in future whenever we get a chance. As you know, even before this measure came, I brought in an amendment to Section 293 prohibiting donations to political parties. We may do it from this side of the House through Private Members' Bills. Now, I will make a few suggestions. Whatever little improvements have been made, despite the fact that they have not gone very far at all, very much will depend on how the law is administered, and we find from our experience that whenever a measure of this kind is passed, containing neither so bad, nor so good provisions, they are not properly implemented. There are certain provisions in the Bill which are important and they should be enforced. We can enforce them. Sir, great responsibility devolves on the Department of Company Affairs. In this connection, you will have noticed that in the course of the discussions, none from this side or from the other side of the House made any adverse remarks about the Company Law Administration. We have done so not because we have not got one or two complaints about them but we know that they have been subjected to severe attack by big businessmen who are trying to malign the Department of Company Affairs and make it look as if it is a bureaucratic Department not interested in public good but interested in self-aggrandisement and so on. That is why, we thought that this institution, the Department of Company Affairs, should be given a little protection and that protection we have given. What we would not like is this. Firstly, we would like the organisation to be developed in very many centres like Kolkata, Kanpur, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, etc. But you do not have enough officers. I think in order to implement a measure of this kind, we must have a larger number of officers and personnel. Some people might ask how is it that the Communist Party which has been pressing for economy now comes out with this suggestion for extension of what might be called the bureaucracy? I do not view it from this angle at all because no party is going to implement this. It is the Government which will have to implement the measure and above all it is the Department of Company Affairs which will have to implement this. That is why, they should be given adequate personnel for dealing with so vast and complicated a problem as this. If you look into the Report of the Department of Company Affairs, you will find that the number of inspectors and others is very few even in a place like Kolkata which is a big business centre. I think Mumbai and Kolkata together account for nearly 45 per cent of the companies. Now, the number is very small. Therefore, it has to be increased. I do not say that the top should be increased, but it should be duly increased. Then, Sir, the responsibility must be passed on to Parliament. The Department of Company Affairs should listen to what everybody says, read what is written about the company management, big business concerns, read what they say in the Press, what we from the Opposition say. They do not come to listen to the debates, but they can certainly get hold of the proceedings and study them. They can study what appears in the newspapers and take measures. My experience in this matter is not so happy. We had brought many things to the notice of the House. We had named concerns like Fair growth and so on. We had named many people that way so that investigation could take place. Up to date, we do not know what has happened. Therefore, it is essential that, when we bring things to the knowledge of the House, or to the knowledge of the Department of Company Affairs, they should look into them. Not only that. We should have at least some kind of an assurance that they are looking into them, and we would be interested in knowing the results of their examination. I do not say that you believe everything, that we say. But certainly, when things are said by various parties, from responsible quarters, whether in the Press or by the representatives of the public, they need to be looked into with a certain measure of seriousness. That seriousness seems to be lacking. Then, Sir, there is a fear on the part of the Department of Company Affairs about doing certain things against people very high up. They should be free from that fear. I think it will be a creditable action if they could haul up certain elements in big business and fix them up for the crimes they are committing. Even if certain Ministers and others may be annoyed with them, the entire people will bless the Department of Company Affairs for this yeoman service.",
212: "Madam, the Railway Minister has again come before the House with his Appropriation Bill. Taking advantage of the occasion, I would like to put some points about the performance of the Railways before the Hon’ble Minister for clarification. While the Hon’ble Minister has come out with his Appropriation Bill, he has also come up with another proposal that to implement the Pay Commission’s award, he will have to raise some moneys to the tune of Rs. 320 crores by raising the freight structure of the Indian Railways. Only nine months back, when the Railway Budget was placed before Parliament, the Railway Minister justified the necessity for a hike in passenger fares, and that too for better performance of the Railways and for giving more amenities to the passengers. Of course, there is not enough scope for a thorough review of the performance of the Railways during the last nine months, but still some points may be discussed. Definitely, the Minister will take pride in his own performance. But I do not know whether the Hon’ble Minister has any knowledge or connection with what the passengers say about the Railways. Perhaps, he may not be having any contact with the ordinary public who travels by the Railways. They have a number of substantial complaints against the performance of the Railways. True, some new trains have been introduced during this time and for some of the trains the running time has been reduced, but not to the extent to which it was there five or six years back. But if you look at the railway system as a whole, you will find that improvement of the total railway system has remained at a big zero, there is no improvement if you look at the overall performance of the railways. Madam, during this period both the passenger traffic and the freight traffic have gone up, and that has given additional revenue to the Railway administration. But what about proper utilization of the money that the Railways are earning for the proper administration of the railway system? Now, on the one hand, the Railway Minister has come up with a proposal for a hike in the freight structure and, on the other, the Railway Ministry has decided to set up a Railway Finance Corporation to raise Rs. 250 crores, because of inadequacy of budgetary support for the Indian Railways. During the Third Five Year Plan, 16 per cent of the National Plan was allocated for the Railways. Then, it started reducing. In the Tenth Plan, it came down to 5 per cent and in the Eleventh Plan it is expected to the 6 per cent. It means the allocation for the Railways, which is the biggest public utility service in our country, is a very small fraction of the total outlay available in our Plans. Who is responsible for this? Are the public to suffer for this and will the Government every year come up with proposals for raising passenger fares or the freight structure? Only nine months back they came up with a proposal and raised the passenger fares. Now they are raising the freight structure. This is putting additional burden on the people as a whole. What will be the effect on the economy in general if these Rs. 320 crores are collected through this hike in the freight structure? It will have a disastrous effect on the total economy. That will lead to serious inflation. If we go in for a rise in the administered prices by raising the freight structure, they say, it may lessen the burden on the people or minimise the burden on the people. Whatever it is, the fact is that the effect of this hike in the freight structure will be serious on the total economy and prices of all essential commodities are bound to go up. So, Madam, I feel that the Railway administration is putting additional burdens on the people several times every year. Now, coming back to the passenger traffic, I would like to mention that some trains have been introduced. But I do not know whether the Minister has any experience of travelling in the second class or in ordinary trains, besides the Rajdhani or two or three superfast trains. There are deplorable conditions in the passenger trains that are running in our country. Without water, without light, without the minimum amenities, the passengers have to travel in a very pitiable condition. And reserved compartments are full of people who are without reservation, and people are compelled to travel in that way. Because of the shortage of accommodation, people have to travel like beasts, and without reservation people come to reserved compartments. The reservation has also been reduced to a farce. Now a days, to make a reservation in an ordinary first class or ordinary second class has no meaning because people would not be able to travel in their reserved seats and they will be made to stand, while others without reservation will sit there.",
213: "Mr. Deputy Chairman, I rise to support the Bill. The Bill deals with some of the practical problems of implementation of a very useful measure. Till 1948, in this country, we had the legislation to deal with the minimum wage problem. All wages, particularly minimum wages, in the country were fixed by tribunals and earlier than the tribunals, they were fixed by some committees. We, in Uttar Pradesh, for example, had the good fortune of the minimum wage of textile labour in Kanpur being fixed by a committee in 1938 over which Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the President of India, himself presided. In Mumbai, they had a committee with Mr. Jairamdas Daulatram as Chairman and that committee fixed the minimum wages. That was the pattern of fixation of minimum wages till 1948. But then this pattern, this sort of enquiry, was not a feature of the day-to-day life of the workers of the country. Only in case the workers were vocal, only in case the workers were organised and demanded the fixation of a minimum wage, the Government took the unusual step of appointing an enquiry committee, which took years. The recommendations did not have any statutory force behind them. The reports of those committees were important documents which prepared public opinion and when it was for the workers and the employers to try their strength, the workers had public opinion behind them. The Act of 1948 was a step in the right direction, a step in accordance with the Convention of the I.L.O., which makes it necessary that minimum wages should be fixed. This Act was a remarkable piece of legislation, because it provided protection and help to workers, who were by the very nature of their employment, by the very nature of the industries in which they were employed, not in a position to organise themselves sufficiently strongly, were not in a position to win a minimum wage for themselves by their own organised strength, as workers in the Ahmedabad and Mumbai textile industry did long ago. The minimum wages Act was an Act to help the poorest, the most downtrodden sections of the toiling population of our country. Many industries in this country were prospering on sweated labour, and this Act made it necessary for them to pay minimum wages. These minimum wages only provided them with the barest means of subsistence and it was very necessary that it should have been done. This legislation was, of course, necessary, because the workers in most of these industries which are mentioned in Parts I and II of the Schedule in the parent Act, were not organised enough. The Act of 1948 has not been implemented as expeditiously and as widely as we would like. There are certain industries like the tannery industry in Uttar Pradesh where the minimum wages have not been fixed in spite of the fact that the Act is 13 years old. There are other instances also from other states. In the case of agricultural labour, the progress has been much slower than it was expected though the original Act of 1948 laid down that the minimum wages for agricultural and industrial workers should be fixed within three years. Sir, it is now thirteen years since that Act came into being and we find that even after these thirteen years, in the case of agricultural labour, we have not done what was originally intended to be done in three years. There are undoubtedly a number of practical difficulties, but there is also a fact to be reckoned with that all the State Governments are not equally enthusiastic about fixation of minimum wages for agricultural labour. It is correct to say that it will be no use fixing minimum wages and not being able to enforce them. But that was something which was taken into consideration when the original Bill was considered. When the minimum wages Act of 1948 was enacted, all this was taken into consideration. It is only reasonable to expect that minimum wages for agricultural labour will be fixed as quickly as possible and that those States which have not done so will be pulled up by the Centre as best as the Centre can. The present Bill mainly deals with that situation. It is correct, Sir, as has been stated in the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Bill, in the case of those industries in the Schedule, those sweated industries for which this Act was meant, quite a substantial percentage of workers has been covered, but the same cannot be said of agricultural labour. It would have been much better if the Government was in a position to say the same about agricultural labour. It is because of lack of enthusiasm on the part of State Governments that our Labour Ministry has come to this House.",
214: "Mr. Deputy Chairman, Sir, I must admit that I am not very happy regarding this particular Bill. The Hon’ble Minister has told the House that whenever the President took the authority under Article 356 of the Constitution and whenever there was the President’s proclamation, every time such a Bill was brought forward before Parliament, and Parliament approved that Bill. It is true, but at the same time, it is also true that this kind of routine which is now being followed from time to time is creating a situation in which Parliament, which is given a very important function under Article 356 of the Constitution, is divesting itself of that function. In order to fully appreciate, Sir, the significance of such a move, it is necessary to go into the history of this sort of powers that were conferred on Parliament by the Constitution in the past. Sir, under the Government of India Act, 1935, under Section 93, some such situation was contemplated and certain provisions were made in case such a situation arose either at the Centre or in some of the provinces, as they were called at that time. At that time, it was decided that the Governor-General should have both the executive as well as the legislative power in his hands in case such a situation arose either at the Centre or in the provinces. Now, the framers of the Constitution have not accepted that particular formula when our Constitution was framed and have definitely made a distinction between the executive power and the legislative power and they have stated that as far as executive power is concerned, the President can straightway take these powers into his hands through a proclamation but as far as legislative powers are concerned, these powers vest in Parliament. The Constitution provides that Parliament in its turn might delegate these powers to the President or to some authority to be named by him, but obviously, when this distinction between the executive and the legislative power was made in the Constitution, it is reasonable to suppose that only under exceptional circumstances the Parliament was to delegate that power to the President again or to any authority to be named by him. If it was the intention of the framers of the Constitution that the legislative as well as the executive power should vest in the President himself, then the scheme which was envisaged in Section 93 of the Government of India Act would have been copied in the Constitution. The very fact that it has not been done clearly shows that the framers of the Constitution expect Parliament to exercise the legislative power and only in exceptional circumstances should this power be delegated to the President or to any authority to be named by him. This was to my mind, the real intention and the real scheme as it is envisaged in the Constitution, but what do we find? Whenever there is a proclamation, automatically, this Bill is brought and passed by Parliament and the powers are vested in the President. What is the necessity of the ritual to be gone through at the time of every proclamation whereby the Parliament might divest itself of its power the moment it has got it? There seems to be no sense in this type of ritual to be gone through after every proclamation. It has been stated that this becomes necessary because of the fact that Parliament might not have sufficient time to consider the various bills and therefore it is desirable that this power should be vested in the President. Again, I ask the same question: were not the framers of the Constitution aware of the fact that there was the function which Parliament had to perform regarding the Central Government and that Parliament might not find time to look into the legislative matters of the territories, the executive power and the legislative power for which have been taken away by the Centre? Here again, the very fact that the Constitution is passed is proof that Parliament is supposed to function as originally envisaged and it clearly shows that the Constitution expects this Parliament to find time to discharge its functions. I am not at all satisfied that there would not be sufficient time for this Parliament to go into the various problems that are connected with the exercise of the legislative powers which were originally in the legislature and which were, because of the proclamation, vested in Parliament. We have been told that there are certain bills which are to be gone through and that this House adjourned earlier and the two Houses might not be in session simultaneously, and therefore, these difficulties might arise. May I ask the Hon’ble Minister: does not the same argument also apply to the legislative business as far as the Centre is concerned? The Centre has to go through a large number of legislative measures.",
215: "The President's Address makes a mention of labour relations, which, we are happy, have definitely improved in the country and, but for the short-lived partial strike of the Central Government employees' last year, the country has seen a period of unprecedented industrial peace. It must, however, be mentioned that this industrial peace, an achievement of the country, is not based on a proper distribution of national income. It was with a view to giving the labour of the country, the working people of the country, a share in the rising national income that the Eleventh Plan provided for the appointment of Wage Boards for certain industries. It is a matter of not a little disappointment that Wage Boards were set up only for three out of the eight industries for which they were provided during the Tenth Five Year Plan. Labour in the country has helped a great deal in achieving the industrial progress of which the President has correctly made a mention. It is the hard work, discipline and enthusiasm of the working people which is responsible for the improvement in our economic situation of which a mention has correctly been made. It is this section of the working people of our country which has, unfortunately, not shared the gains of productivity, which has not shared the gains of improvement in the economic life of the country. It was with a view to giving the workers a reasonable share of the gains of our increasing prosperity that the Wage Boards were thought of for eight major industries. The workers in the country are disappointed that only in the case of sugar, cotton and cement industries, Wage Boards were appointed and these bodies finished their work during the Eleventh Plan period. That disappointment is further accentuated because of the fact that the employers in the country have not readily and enthusiastically implemented the unanimous recommendations of these bodies which were tripartite in nature, in which the employers of the country were also represented. The Government has not made up its mind about the recommendations of the Wage Board for the sugar industry and even the Government resolutions in the case of cement and the cotton textile industries have not been implemented by the industrialists. It is a matter of great disappointment. It indicates that the people who talk so much of industrial peace are really not interested as much in industrial peace based on sharing of the gains of increased production as they are interested in intensifying the rate of exploitation. The Government should be able to see that its resolutions in the matter of recommendations of Wage Boards, particularly in the case of the textile industry, are implemented by the industry of the country as a whole. Sir, there are certain industries whose workers are making a significant contribution in the matter of our economic growth. To mention only two, the rising engineering industry and the public utility industries like the electricity supply industry are the very cornerstones of our industrial progress. It is a matter of very great disappointment that the Government has not yet appointed Wage Boards for these industries. Sir, it is well recognised that the employees in the public utility industries like electricity supply and water supply are denied certain rights, as the right to strike and the right of direct action, which employees in other industries readily enjoy and it is only fair that the employees in the case of public utility industries, like electricity supply, should be among the first to be given the advantage of tripartite bodies like Wage Boards, and their conditions of work, their wages, their standard of living should be increased as a matter of course as a matter of administration of social justice. It is a great disappointment to the workers in the electricity supply and engineering industries of the country that Wage Boards for these industries have not so far been appointed. Sir, the President's Address mentions the implementation of the Employees' State Insurance Scheme. That scheme is a benefit for which the workers of the country are highly thankful. The scheme of Employees' State Insurance guards the health of the workers and ensures that during the period of their sickness they not only get medical leave but also half of their wages. That is a great relief to the workers and we are thankful that the scheme has been extended from one area to the other. It is, however, a matter of some disappointment that in spite of the fact that the Act was enacted in 1998, the scheme does not cover as many factory workers of the country as it should. The fact that this scheme has been found useful by labour and industry in the country and the fact that both workers and industry contribute to the running of this scheme makes it all the more necessary that the implementation of this scheme should be accelerated and all the 6 lakhs of factory workers should be brought under the scheme.",
216: "Sir, this is the tenth report that has come before the Hon'ble House for its comments. We are aware, Sir, that on previous occasions certain matters were discussed and I am very happy to find that the UPSC have acknowledged the full cooperation which the Ministries and the Departments have given them in carrying out their duties. So far as the present report is concerned, it has mentioned certain circumstances which have to be looked into very carefully. It has also pointed out certain difficulties in getting the full strength from recruitment. It has also pointed out certain irregularities. Lastly, only in one case out of 15,000 that has been referred to the UPSC, there had been a difference of opinion and the Government had to depart from their advice and take action on the lines that have been pointed out in the memorandum. Thus, you will find, Sir, that there has been the fullest measure of cooperation from the Government, as they are anxious that the views expressed and the recommendations made by the UPSC should receive the fullest respect and that as far as possible they should be implemented. Sir, in the course of the report they have pointed out that in certain cases they find it difficult to make recruitment. They have mentioned three cases. One is with regard to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes. You are aware, Sir, that in respect of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes, whenever there is to be direct recruitment, a certain percentage has been fixed. It is quite different in the case of all India Services. It is still higher in the case of other services that have to be dealt with. In all these cases, whenever there has been such a reservation, the UPSC have been requested to follow what are known as relaxed standards provided they feel that after taking into account the relaxed standards, the particular candidates come up to the minimum prescribed qualifications. As the House is aware, the UPSC have been given this discretion, and they have been using it quite fully but all the same, they have to point out, as they have done in this report, that there are occasions when the requirement of the quota that has to be filled, so far as the Scheduled Castes and Tribes are concerned, does not come up to the requirement that is given. Though no reference has been made here, they have also pointed out that the complaint, or rather the deficiency, was very great so far as the all India services were concerned. It was true that in certain cases they came from families where the environment was not what it ought to have been and, therefore, on earlier occasions expression was given in this House, as in the other, that some arrangement should be made for the purpose of giving tuition to some of those candidates who were likely to appear at these all India competitive examinations. This question was taken up with the various Universities. It was the Allahabad University that agreed to have such a course of tuition, and I am aware that the course of training through which the Scheduled Caste and the Scheduled Tribe candidates have gone during the year has been of immense value in respect of their general training. They have come up fairly high and the results are far better even at the final all India competitive examinations than they were formerly. That is a step that the Government have specially taken for them. In other respects also, wherever it is possible, it is the desire of the Government to see that such special tuition or training is offered to those classes of people for whom some reservation has been made. But, still, candidates to the extent of a suitable number are not available in spite of all the attempts made in that direction. Then, they have pointed out that in certain cases, especially where Government servants have to be appointed at such distant places as Manipur or Tripura, the North-eastern States, or at Pondicherry also, candidates are not forthcoming for serving in those areas. In fact, this is one of the great difficulties so far as these States are concerned. As the House is aware, we are anxious to see that the tone of administration there improved to the fullest measure and that it comes at par with that of the other enlightened States of India. Therefore, special steps are being taken. All the same, in spite of certain alluring concessions that are made to them, the number of candidates that are ready to serve in these distant areas is not very large. Therefore, the UPSC has expressed that in such cases, it finds it difficult to get the full strength and submit the figures. Similarly also, there are certain fields in technology and others where it becomes difficult to get good candidates.",
217: "Mr. Deputy Chairman, Sir, I would, at the outset, like to thank the Hon'ble Members who have taken part in this discussion for drawing the attention of this House to a very valuable report. The fact that he himself has contributed to this report does not in any way minimise the importance of this reference because this report deals with a subject which is of very great importance. But because it has not any immediate sensational impact, there is sometimes a tendency for such reports to be overlooked, and from that point of view, Shri Bhargava certainly deserves the thanks of this House and, I think, the thanks of my Ministry for having drawn its pointed attention to this report. Sir, he has given the history of how the Vigyan Mandir scheme began. I do not want to go into very great detail of that but the Hon'ble Members of this House will remember that the idea was originally mooted in 1983. There was only one institution established at that time. The main purpose was to bring about a scientific atmosphere in our villages. They are not so much service institutions. Sir, some of the remarks which were made today probably suffered from misunderstanding on that point, and one Hon'ble member, a very distinguished Member of this House, was surprised as to how a single officer could perform so many functions efficiently. Now, if these were service agencies engaged in soil analysis or analysis of health problems or applying actual remedial measures, this criticism would have been completely justified. But, in fact, the Vigyan Mandirs are conceived primarily as centres for disseminating scientific knowledge and creating a scientific atmosphere in the villages, and that is why, in each Vigyan Mandir the four most important things are the library and laboratory attached to it, the reading room, the museum and the science club. Through the laboratory, simple experiments can be performed partly for service purposes but more in order to make villagers familiar with the techniques of science and to make them realise how science can be of immediate value and significance in their personal life. For example, the Vigyan Mandir officer may not be in a position to give a solution of the problem of soil analysis, but he can show by experiment how diseases spread through parasites. Of course, this knowledge is becoming fairly widespread in the country now but in spite of that there are areas in the country where anything which is done to spread such knowledge could be valuable. Then the reading room with scientific literature is there. As yet, these rooms are not very well equipped because we have just begun, but there is not enough literature in the Indian languages to be of service to the villagers and the various items of literature in English or in any other language which the villager does not know would not be of great use to him. The science museum has a dual purpose, on the one hand, of making the people in the locality aware of what are the scientific potentialities of the various objects of interest from the scientific or other points of view for those particular localities but there is also the other purpose that through those science museums, a spirit of enquiry is inculcated in the young men. They make these collections and bring them to the museums with the result that the museums are today the centres where cooperation in the building up of the museum gives both a sense of participation and also some preliminary training in the scientific methods of collection. Then, there are the Science Clubs which also have the same purpose on a larger scale by trying to bring the schools into the picture. The teachers and the pupils of the schools would be the nucleus of the Science Clubs and through them gradually scientific knowledge and scientific attitude would percolate among the older generation. These are the main purposes and if we keep them in view, the Vigyan Mandirs are essentially centres for dissemination of knowledge and, only secondarily, service institutions. We have actually decided that wherever any health clinic is established or any soil analysis station is established by the Ministry concerned, the Vigyan Mandirs will no longer perform these services but refer the people to the more developed institutions run by the respective Ministries. It was in this way that the Vigyan Mandir Scheme began and as will be seen from this report itself, in the first 4 or 5 years, the progress was not very adequate. There were only 18 Vigyan Mandirs when this Ministry was formed in 1978. In five years, only 18 had been established throughout India, and we therefore felt that we should try to have a larger number of Vigyan Mandirs. Ultimately, the aim should be to have at least one for every district, but we realized that that could not be done during the Plan period.",
218: "Mr. Chairman, the subject matter of this Bill is very interesting in the sense that it deals with certain institutions and institutional arrangements that have got a long history. In this country, there are many institutions, organisations, and religious endowments that were created as a result of the prevalence of the caste system and the organisation of our community on a religious basis. These organisations and institutions were called upon to perform certain functions which we today associate with the welfare state. There was a time, Sir, in the history of our nation when it was these religious organisations and institutions that undertook to discharge certain functions like imparting education to those who were not in a position either to pay for that education or were not in a position to go to the educational institutions for certain family reasons. In order that the bright young men and women could be helped in pursuing their studies it was found necessary that the religious organisations should step in by giving scholarships to the people belonging to a particular community or to a particular caste and by helping the families of those persons who were thus engaged in educational pursuits during the period that they were so engaged. Similarly, when the poor families were not in a position to make two ends meet, the same religious endowments and other institutions and organisations stepped in to help these families. In this way, a large number of activities were undertaken by these charitable organisations and institutions at a time when the state was not prepared to undertake these responsibilities on its own shoulder. The question that now arises is whether we have reached a stage wherein it is possible for the state to step in and to undertake these very activities so that these religious organisations and institutions might not have to perform those functions. Connected therewith is also the question of whether the Government should give its patronage to these organisations and institutions or whether the Government should allow these organisations and institutions to function on their own. The Bill only deals with the second part of the question but the determination of the issue depends, to a very great extent, on what we consider to be our answer to the first part also. It is now well known that we have adopted the principle of the welfare state and that we now look up to the state to go to the help of the needy citizen in some of his needs that are so very urgent and important and the fulfilment of which is considered to be so necessary from the point of view not only of the welfare of the individual but of the stability of the community also, and it is on this principle that we expect the state to undertake and discharge these functions. Therefore, it is desirable that the religious institutions and organisations are discouraged, as far as possible, from undertaking these obligations because of the fact that the need of the citizen has nothing to do with the caste or the religion to which he belongs. His needs arise out of the fact that he is a human being, that he is circumscribed by a certain situation and handicapped up to a point whereby it is not possible for him to satisfy his needs in the normal way and therefore he looks up to the state to come to his help. Because of the fact that his needs arise from his being an individual and citizen of the country, it is desirable that his needs are satisfied in a manner whereby he is considered as a human being and a citizen of this country and not as a person belonging to any particular caste or religion or religious organisation. That is the reason why it is desirable that these religious organisations and institutions should be discouraged from discharging these functions because as long as these institutions and organisations carry on these functions, the consciousness of belonging to a particular caste or to a particular community remains very much alive. If I belong to a particular caste or to a particular community and if I have been helped by an organisation belonging to that caste, it is but natural that if I am later on placed in such favourable circumstances, my gratitude demands that I, in my turn, help the people belonging to my own community and to my own caste. In this way, the consciousness of caste and community persists which, we have now begun to realise, has done untold harm to our country. We want to see that this compartmentalisation of our society into castes and communities should go. The consciousness of belonging to a particular caste or to a particular community should be replaced by the consciousness of belonging to the nation as a whole, so that the emotional integration of the nation could be speeded up. Because of this consciousness, it is also desirable that religious organisations and institutions should be discouraged from undertaking these functions.",
219: "Mr. Deputy Chairman, while speaking on the Appropriation Bill, I would like to discuss a little disparity in the matter of the distribution of the allocations to the different States. Sir, there are many backward States in this country, including Assam. Generally, the allocation of the Central grants for all these States is not, I submit, in proportion to the needs or according to the income of the particular State. The Government of Assam has in its present Budget shown a deficit of nearly Rs. 30 crores and it has also been stated that it is not possible to collect this amount within the State itself by additional taxation or otherwise. As a matter of fact, the Government of Assam has been complaining to the Centre about the inadequacy or rather the disproportion in the grants made from the income tax collected from the resources in Assam and from the excise duties on tea, jute, etc. as well as on petroleum. Sir, until some more adequate finances are made available to that State from the resources of the State itself, this deficit will go on and the development of this State would be hampered. It is time, something was done because it has been accepted as a principle that we should devote a little more attention towards the development of the backward people and the backward areas. Assam is one of the most backward areas. It is almost the most backward area and I think in the matter of giving finances, the Government of India should give a little more money for the development of that State. That State is backward in many respects. We have to see that this disparity that is there in this country and which is widening in certain places is removed as early as possible and to bring in more industrialisation of the backward places. Assam, being one such backward State, there should be more consideration given to it. Then, there is the question of communication in the State of Assam. Some attempts have been made for developing communications in that State, but no industrialist has yet been tempted to come to that State to start an industrial undertaking and take advantage of the immense natural resources of that State and utilise them for the benefit of that State and for that of the whole country. So, the development of communications is another important factor. The development that has taken place is not at all enough and the pace of progress has to be much swifter so that the State could be brought on par with the other States. The general complaint everywhere is that the Posts and Telegraphs Department has not been very efficient or that it has deteriorated in efficiency in many places. People have been complaining of not receiving telegrams in time and of not receiving their letters. This is the case not only in Assam, but elsewhere also. Of course, it depends on the efficiency of the people who are administering this Department. Therefore, I submit more attention should be given to the efficiency in this particular Department so that people may not have the grievance regarding the receipt or delivery of telegrams and letters. Firstly, I have to say something about the department dealing with statistics. The authenticity of these statistical information is always being questioned from all quarters. Generally, we find that these statistics are collected from official papers, and those official papers are not based on the actual facts. For instance, in the matter of agricultural production we have been hearing for a long time that there has always been an increase in production. But actually, only this year perhaps, during all these five or ten years, has there been a little more production in agriculture, but all these years we have been hearing from these statistical publications that production from agriculture has been increasing all these years. As a matter of fact, production was going below our requirements. So, the statistics should be based on actual village enquiries and not on the papers submitted from the revenue offices through their officers. Now, I have to say a few words about some multi purpose river projects. We have been told that the investigation for one multi purpose project has been going on in Assam. This investigation has been going on for the last ten years or so and every year some money is being allotted for this purpose. We are surprised that this investigation has not yet been completed. In Assam, we have been waiting for power all these years and it has to come from the development of this project and this project alone can supply the power that Assam so badly wants. And Assam is so backward in the matter of power supply. I would like to draw the attention of the Government to the necessity for expedition in respect of investigation of this project. The work on this project should be stopped immediately so that the investigation may be carried out on proper lines without further delay.",
220: "Madam Deputy Chairman, this discussion on the Calling Attention motion for the textile industry has covered the whole gamut of the industry from the grower of cotton to all other sectors. Honourable members have covered the whole field and given a number of suggestions. Madam, textiles is a very important industry in our country and it gives employment and work to millions and millions of people in the villages, in the towns, in the rural areas and in the cities. Government is fully aware of its importance in our national life from the economic, social and every other point of view. Broadly, there are three sectors of the industry: the unorganized handloom sector, the unorganized powerloom sector and the organized mill sector. Madam, you would have observed from the speeches made here that there are some inherent contradictions in the interests of the various sectors. Some Members have, in the same breath, tried to support all the sectors and, obviously, there have been contradictions in their arguments and their presentation. If you want higher prices for the cotton grower, how can you expect reasonable prices of cotton yarn for the handloom and powerloom sectors? So, because of this obvious contradiction, there is a demand all over that the textile policy has failed and therefore it should be reviewed. Madam, the textile policy was meant basically to reconcile the varying and, at times, conflicting interests of the various sectors and, therefore, it has not found favour with any one sector, and all the sectors are, more, or less, feeling dissatisfied. This is bound to happen when you have a very balancing proposition like the new textile policy where the various interests have to be reconciled and given proper place. The textile policy can be judged from three or four points of view, and it has proved successful from those angles. There has been an increase in overall cloth production, there is an increase in per capita availability of cloth, there is a great increase in exports, and the rate of increase in the price of cloth has been minimal. Compared to the general rise in the cost of living, it is very little – just 2 per cent as against more than eight per cent – which means the common man is benefited. He is getting more cloth at a very reasonable price compared to other consumer goods and other things that are available to him. So, while the difficulties that have been mentioned are real, I would like to say that the policy has by and large succeeded in its aim and has proved quite satisfactory. Therefore, to review it in a manner that would satisfy everybody is just not possible. But as we go along, we are trying to modulate this policy and implement this policy in a way in which we can give as much satisfaction to a sector which needs attention at a particular time. So, there is no question of this policy having been framed on account of pressures from the mill sector or the capitalists in the mill sector, as has been said, because they have suffered the most. There has been increase in the production in the handloom sector, increase in the production in the powerloom sector, but there is a fall in the production in the mill sector. As has been said, mills have been closed in Ahmedabad and Mumbai. If it were weighted in favour of the capitalists in the mill sector, as it has been said, why have they suffered the most? So, we have tried to do a very balancing exercise in this way and we will see that we try to protect everybody to the extent possible. But why is it that all the sectors are suffering? Madam, there is some basic difficulty in the whole situation which we have tried to go into. There has been excess capacity on the weaving side, and there has been fall in purchasing power because of the successive droughts and floods. These are two important reasons as of now why all the sectors are suffering. It has been said that the yarn prices have risen or the cotton prices have risen. It has not contributed so much as it has been made out. Now, I will just come to some figures regarding the price of cotton. Cotton prices have risen pretty high. But, if you take the price rise so far as yarn is concerned, it has not been as bad. From June, 2005 to September, 2007, raw cotton prices rose by 62 per cent. Cotton yarn prices during the same period increased by only 33 per cent. We have been varying our policies as we went along. First, we decided to export cotton because last year there was a glut in cotton and we had to procure a larger amount of cotton from the producer at the minimum support price. So, we thought that a little export would help the producer and we allowed the export.",
221: "Mr. Deputy Chairman, Sir, during the last two Five Year Plans we found improvement in production all round. Now, we are entering the Eleventh Plan and it is only proper that we should carefully ponder over the whole matter and see in what things we are lagging behind and what improvements are necessary. My submission is that the Plan is a huge one. We have had to get foreign assistance. We have taxed our people. Therefore, every rupee of it must be carefully spent, and that is what is very necessary. Planning at the Centre is very good, very appropriate, but the implementation, the execution of it in the States, is not as it should be. We find that every year more money under a particular head is spent hurriedly within the last two or three months and within the first nine months money is very slowly spent. What happens is, things are not done properly, things are not done economically and there is a great wastage. The feeling of austerity, the feeling of economy is not there, and unless it is there, unless we feel that every rupee should be spent very carefully, the amount that has been allotted will not be sufficient. We probably might require more. Therefore, I would very humbly submit that there should be a feeling of austerity and a feeling of doing the duty in the proper manner. There should be economy all round. I think there is wastefulness. That is my general impression. I move about in the villages, I go to the different blocks, I go to the towns and I go to the cities. There is not that austerity, there is not that determination that is essential for the successful implementation of such a huge Plan. Therefore, my submission is that the mind of the Government should be centred round this fact. It should give an impression to all its subordinate officers that they should be very active, very careful and very economical. I find that in spite of all improvements, the prices of foodstuffs and are rising every day and if this goes on, there will be no zest for the Five Year Plan among the masses. They want something substantial. I know that roads have been built, I know that there are schools, there are dispensaries and there are other amenities but that does not help the poor man. He wants food and primarily he is anxious about that and so long as things remain as they are, the enthusiasm which is necessary for the successful implementation of the Plan will not be there. We find all round a feeling of depression among the village people. Those who are landless or those who have small pieces of land feel depressed when they find that there is no food for them and that feeling creates frustration and it never helps to achieve good results. Therefore, my submission is that special attention has to be paid to stop the rise in the prices of foodstuffs and cloth. Again, in the villages we find that the wages are very meagre. In the towns, of course, the people get good wages but the labourers in villages are as before. No proper legislation is there to see that they get proper wages. We find that people are without any occupation in the rural areas. We thought that within these 10 years, there will be a large number of cottage industries in the villages. We find that only in regard to agriculture, there is improvement visible all round but in the villages there is very little of cottage industries. No industrial enterprise is there and therefore I would humbly submit that this aspect of the question should be carefully seen to. Now, what we find in the villages is that the new chemical fertilisers are being greatly welcomed. This is not so very good because the poor people cannot afford to have chemical fertilisers. Compost should be encouraged more and more, and then they can use their green leaves, cow-dung, etc., and they can get manure. This is how things were done before but they were not done properly and so the net result was not so good. But I can assure you that some time back the yield was much better than what it is now. These chemical fertilisers require a lot of water and there is a general programme of pushing in these fertilisers even where there is no water. So there is failure. This aspect of the question has also to be carefully considered and properly thought out before we supply fertilisers to the poor people. Now, the question of unemployment is really creating a great depression. We are having colleges all round. Graduates are coming out of these colleges but when they go from place to place, they find no vacancy. It is because we do not have the required curriculum, and we only have these ordinary science courses and arts courses. Technical education is not being given that place which it should have.",
222: "Mr. Deputy Chairman, I rise to intervene in the debate only because of certain observations made by the hon’ble Member from Rajasthan about the Rajasthan Canal. I have got the greatest regard for the hon’ble Member and I can appreciate that whatever he said was only in his anxiety to expediate the construction of the Rajasthan Canal. He correctly paid a tribute to the work of the Irrigation and Power Ministry and he also said that when he saw the mighty projects under construction, not only he but the other foreign experts too, were wonder-struck, to put it in his own words, at the progress made by the country in respect of irrigation and power development. It is but fair that he should have made these observations because the huge task of building mighty river projects in the country, the various technicalities involved therein, the number of problems the engineers have to tackle and the spirit of team work with which they carry on the work are bound to create admiration for the work that they have been doing. I am grateful to the hon’ble Member for paying that tribute. It is, therefore, that I want to clarify certain points. He made out a case that because the Rajasthan Canal was a project of national importance, the Centre should take over the control of that project and not leave it to the Rajasthan Government. As I mentioned, with great regard that I have for him I tried to analyse the reasons and arguments for his apprehensions about the progress of the Rajasthan Canal. In the other House, the same apprehension was expressed by another Member from Rajasthan Canal. As opinions differ about the capacity of that state or about the capacity of the engineers, another Member in that House observed that the progress of the Rajasthan Canal was very satisfactory and he went on further to say that the apprehension, which the hon’ble Member had expressed, was not reasonable and had no basis. That is what the other Member from Rajasthan in the other House expressed. Therefore, I want to know exactly what he wants. I find from the proceedings that he thinks that the regional interests in that area or in that State are likely to prejudice the construction and, therefore, the Centre should take over the work. I may assure the hon’ble Member that the Centre is very closely associated with the execution of the Rajasthan Canal. There is the Rajasthan Canal Control Board and on that formerly there was no representative of the Ministry. Looking to the importance of the project, the Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Irrigation and Power, the Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Finance and a Member or the Chairman of the Central Water and Power Commission are now associated with the working of the Control Board. Moreover, there is a Committee of Direction which gives direction for the construction of the project and lays down the policy. That Committee is presided over by the Minister of Irrigation and Power, Government of India. The Chief Minister of Rajasthan and the Chief Minister of Punjab are members of this Committee of Direction. Therefore, from the point of view of the day-to-day execution as well as from the point of view of the policy question, the Centre is very closely associated with the execution of the project. If the hon’ble Members wants that the project should be executed by the Centre directly, it may not be possible. It is not possible because even under the Constitution, we do not directly execute any project. The House might recall that the Estimates Committee recommended that the Centre should not directly take up any execution work. They must work as technical advisers or in overall supervision of the project. They should not take up the direct execution of any project. But as the project is of national importance, we have a very careful watch on the execution of the project. We see that in matters of policy the decisions are taken by the Committee of Direction and the day-to-day execution is taken up by the Control Board. Then, I went further to analyse the other reason why he wants the Centre to take over the project. He says that the construction of the Rajasthan Canal is lagging behind the schedule by two months for lack of supplies of cement and coal. Now, if the construction is lagging behind by two months that it is not such a grave factor as to cause that sort of apprehension. Even then, it is not the cause that because the Centre is not in charge of the execution of the project that the delay, if any, has occurred. The delay in the supply of coal, as everybody knows, was due to difficulties of transport. The delay in the supply of cement was due to short supply. Even then we have in the Central Water and Power Commission a cell which looks after the requirements of the river valley projects.",
223: "Now, I have described in another place at great length the way promotions are made and one of my colleagues on this side yesterday appeared either to have read that statement or in another way has placed before the House not on behalf of the Government, much of the material that I would have dealt with. But here what I want to point out is that these selections are done by well-established procedures, which have been there for many years and have not been altered. In regard to the bulk of the officers, there are complaints from some quarters that perhaps Government ought to look more into it. That is to say, it is not a question of too much interference, but of too little interference with regard to the lower levels. But since that point has not been raised, I do not want to raise this problem myself. But with regard to the higher ranks of the Army it is done by Number One Selection Board, as was pointed out, from Colonels up to Major-Generals, where nine officers sit, that is, the Chief of the Army Staff, his deputy, three Army Commanders and four Principal Staff Officers. They mark these people separately on separate papers and discuss them and in the net result of that discussion, the differences are ironed out. Besides examination of their records, the personal knowledge of these officers by their present or previous Commanders, who would be sitting round the table, would be taken into account. Then, it comes to the Government and the Government, that is the Defence Ministry, examines them, so far as they can, from the papers, that is to say whether the conclusions are warranted by the premises supplied by the books. And then, it is put up before the Minister after discussion in the Ministry itself as to the pros and cons of this matter. Normally, the recommendations that come from the Army Headquarters are accepted and neither in the case that is now spoken about, nor in anything else have these recommendations been turned down. Although I know that observation, I would like to make it clear on behalf of the Government that the Government have the right to turn down these recommendations, because the services are under civilian control. It would be a bad day when the Government responsible to Parliament cannot have the last word in this matter, because it is not merely a question of a soldier being efficient. There may be other matters to be taken into consideration. I am happy to think that no personalities have been introduced, because if the Minister were to pursue the same line as those of the critics and drag the officers in, it would not be in his interest. When we go round to the question of seniorities and supersessions, I would like to say that so far as the lower levels are concerned, that is to say, up to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, the proportions of selections have remained much the same. There is a Variation of two or three per cent. Each year over the last five or six years, but it is more or less a mechanical process. When we come to the selection of Lieutenant-Generals in the Indian Army, it is done not by the Selection Boards. This is done on the recommendation of the Chief of the Army Staff. The Prime Minister offered in the other House on a previous occasion for them to come and see the papers rather unusual, but he, as the Head of the Government, is free to do so. While the offer was open, no one turned up. One person asked to come and we arranged it, but nothing happened. In any case, a Lieutenant-General is appointed by Government on the recommendation of the Chief of the Army Staff. The same process goes through, because, while there is no Selection Board, the Chief of the Army Staff by convention consults the Army Commanders, which is a sort of a selection board of a smaller type. That recommendation comes before us, and within the available people those who have the minimum qualification come first, those who have good record, particularly outstanding qualities. I would like again to say that we are playing upon words. There is no supersession. They are selection appointments. If you take the British Army today, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff is a person who has been superseded twice before, but he comes up again in my experience there has been no appointment to these offices, which has not been recommended in this way, and it is the good fortune of the Government that they have been able to accept it. There has been some disturbance with regard to the recent appointed of Army Commanders. Army Commanders by conventions have been appointed by the Government, even without references to the Chief of Staff, by selection of two or three people, but in this case discussions and consultations have taken place, and I am quite free to say that there is nothing in this appointment which merits criticism.",
224: "Sir, I do not look upon our Plan as an over-ambitious one. One has to remember while considering it that our population is increasing faster than our means of production. We have to meet the challenge of this growing population. Undoubtedly, birth control is important. But it is not easy to carry out propaganda for birth control in a population of illiterate people and superstition-ridden people. Then, Sir, unless we plan boldly, we shall not be able to provide employment for our people. We have to bear in mind that it is essential to provide employment for our increasing population. Even with the Plan carried out, the unemployment figure will stand high, and the question to be considered is whether more attention should not be placed upon our small-scale and medium-sized industries. Is it not possible for us to ensure that all sections of the population get the benefit of the Plan? After ten successful Plans a few industrialists, despite our heavy taxation, own nearly 75 per cent of the total capital of our public companies. Banking facilities for the common man are few, and even banks favour large business houses because they have more guarantees to give than the small people. We have a large landless population and large numbers depend upon it for support. What we need therefore, to plan successfully is greater cohesion, greater emotional integration and greater national unity among ourselves. We are wasting time over quarrels that do not touch the common man. Both the Government and the Opposition parties have responsibilities towards the mass of our people. Is it not possible for all of us, regardless of party labels, to cooperate fully in all those tasks that make for the welfare of the common man? Can we not forget petty, party, sectional, communal and group differences? Is it not possible for us to have a national, as opposed to a mere party outlook towards the problems raised by the Plan? Sir, the general elections are coming. It should not divert our attention from the main task of finding solutions on a national basis to the problems of unemployment, health and education. These are the things that our people mostly need, and to them we must devote our full attention. The second thing that I would like to emphasise is that though our national income has increased by 42 per cent, we do not exactly know how it has been distributed. It is not enough to say that the per capita income has increased. The right question that has to be answered by us is whether it has increased in terms of real income. For that we have to see whether the price level has kept pace with the wage level. It is no satisfaction to a man that his nominal income has gone up, though at the same time the price level has reduced his purchasing power not only for luxury articles but for articles of common consumption. Concessions have been made to industrialists. Perhaps it was inevitable that they should be made. We had to provide incentives for capital formation but the Budget, even after the reliefs given, which I gratefully acknowledge, will, I apprehend, increase the burden of the common man. The middle classes are the backbone of any community. There is dissatisfaction amongst them because of the rising prices. It is essential that in a mixed economy such as ours, the State should evolve a machinery of adequate price control. Prices should not be allowed to go beyond a certain level, and there must be a ceaseless war against hoarder and profiteers. They are pests of society and should be looked upon as such. Equality of sacrifice demands that those who have more should be made to pay more than those who have less. The marginal utility of money is greater with people of less income than with big incomes. The third point that I would like to point out is that concentration of economic power should be discouraged. One of our Articles provides that the ownership and material resources of the country should be so distributed as to subserve the common good. Another Article provides that there should be suitable legislation of a living wage, fair conditions of work, decent standard of life, social and cultural activities and full enjoyment and leisure, as also for the promotion of cottage industries on an individual and cooperative basis in rural areas. The progress of the Plan has to be tested in the light of these objectives. Small and medium-sized concerns should be encouraged so that concentration of wealth may break up. We would like to have the results of the enquiry as to how the national dividend has been distributed early. We should know, who are the classes who have benefited most by our Plans. Are they the people with big capital? The spirit of the Constitution is against the concentration of wealth in single hands and this should be borne in mind by us.",
225: "Mr. Deputy Chairman, I thank you for the courtesy. Our country is today confronted with so many catastrophes, difficulties, problems and so many subject matters which we have discussed here and which we will be discussing later on. In short, our country has been facing so many problems and so many circumstances today. Thanks are due to the President for his historic and illuminating Address. He has thrown light all round, on all the aspects of things which took place the year before and which are existing before us today and which we will have to face hereafter. The President’s Address has received a historic reception not only in this House, but it has received a splendid reception outside also. There is no doubt that things which have been discussed in the historic Address of the President are worth taking into very serious consideration and after passing the Motion of Thanks, we will go out to Act upon them. It cannot be denied that our country in spite of our limited resources and so many situations which have been created since ages past, has progressed by leaps and bounds in various aspects and various spheres of life. There is no doubt about it that the President has kindly thrown the correct light over the development of the country in the various spheres. It is more than correct and today it stands for us as a guiding and illuminating feature for our future improvement and future development. In view of the present developments, who can deny that our country, with its limited resources and with all the other limitations, has shown to the world that, whatever it may be, we poor Indians have got the capacity, have got the courage and have got the patience to develop our country? In a way, we are passing through various difficulties and various limitations. In spite of that, our capacity and our courage has not yet daunted. We have not been discouraged. We are going on with speed on the road of progress, on the road of development. The President has rightly pointed out the advance made in the field of agriculture, in the field of industry and various other fields and those things have been enumerated with facts and figures. The data has been given, and now those things are before us and before the world to be seen and to be examined. But that is not enough. I would say that our country has suffered so much for centuries past in the various fields of development and various spheres of life such as education, health, industry, agriculture, social and political aspects and so many other things. Of course, that requires greater attention, greater energy and greater effort to develop and develop to that extent till we have at least made up those deficiencies from which we have been suffering for ages past. I expected in the President’s Address at least one thing. The future development of the country, the future progress of the country, cannot be in a greater and greater degree than what we have already achieved, unless we have one thing and that thing is our national and emotional integration. Without such integration we cannot do anything. Let me say with regard to what was just being referred to by my various friends in the form of various fissiparous tendencies and incidents in Assam and in other places. It is all due to lack of national integration. That much of national integration has not been developed as yet amongst us, that sort of national and emotional integration which will strengthen our hands, strengthen our spirit, strengthen our soul, strengthen our national stand so that we may correct ourselves if such circumstances befall. The fault lies with us. Also, the fault lies with our Government. The fault lies with our organization that we did not consider it so important. This question of national integration was not considered so serious as it deserved. I still say that all our efforts will become fruitless unless there is national integration. It will be bankruptcy of administration if we do not pay greater heed and attention to the immediate development of national integration in the country. The country is being integrated in all spheres, in all aspects of life, except this one thing which has got its root, where our social and political life has got its root. That root is not being seriously taken into consideration and that sort of national integration is not being developed. It was developed some time back, in the time of Bapuji. In the time of Mahatma Gandhi, that national integration was started. Later on, it was disintegrated. We were expected to look after that, we were expected to carry on that development which was started during the time of Bapuji. You should put down all sorts of anti-national activities. You should put down all sorts of fissiparous tendencies and communal background in responsible places. You are to look after the lives of the people of this country.",
226: "Mr. Deputy Chairman, Sir, I crave the indulgence of the House and also your indulgence for stating certain obvious facts which are very well known but which we are often apt to forget. Sir, the Indian Railway system, as the hon’ble House knows, is the biggest in the whole of Asia and it is the fourth biggest in the world. It is also the biggest nationalised undertaking and nowhere is such a big experiment made and such a large area covered. Sir, when we deal with the Budget proposals, we have to bear in mind this far-reaching character and the historic role that the railway system is playing in this vast country. This Budget, as presented to us, has to be viewed and considered from this larger angle. Though the Budget has taken the usual form of an annual ritual and though it indicates and projects a set pattern, it marks the culmination and the ending of a period of achievement and the budding and flowering of another period of achievement. Sir, we are in a better position today than before to assess and evaluate the results and we can very well draw up a balance sheet of successes and failures, of achievements and setbacks, if there are any, so that we may be able to draw up a plan of further development. During the last five years, efforts have been made by the Ministry of Railways to realise and fulfill the goals and targets laid down in the Plan. To a considerable extent, I must admit they have been able to achieve the goals and targets laid down. All these achievements and developments that have taken place are really commendable and we would not shirk on our side to pay compliments to them because they deserve them. But when I look at the other side, when I consider the drawbacks and failures that we saw during these five years, I feel, Sir, that the progress achieved and the development that they have brought about are not commensurate with the needs and requirements of the growing and developing economy. The Minister in his speech has not been able to assess the extent of demand of the country for additional transport capacity and he has not been able to give us a picture of how this challenge will be met, and met adequately, to remove transport difficulties in the country. I would mention some facts and leave it to the judgment of hon’ble Members as to whether some of the steps that the Railways Ministry has taken during this period of five years have been able to solve the transport difficulties. In spite of the two Plans and the additional capacity released as a result of development, the problem of congestion, which has also been referred to by other hon’ble Members, is proving a great deterrent. It has proved a great deterrent in the past, it is proving a great deterrent at present and perhaps it will prove a greater deterrent hereafter. This problem of congestion has been growing. Perhaps the planners were not able to visualise or anticipate the growing demand for transport in the country. Today, a very critical situation is created in spite of all developments. Goods are not being lifted from the ports, complaints have been received about this. There is a lot of congestion at the various ports and there has been considerable delay in moving goods from port areas. Complaints have also been heard that ores are not being moved from the mining areas and the internal trade is put to a very severe strain. Reference was made to coal transport. Some of the reports which have appeared in today’s papers are very disturbing. We are told that the crisis is very deep in the U.P. areas and, as a result of paucity of coal, many industries, perhaps even the Railways there and the normal life in certain of those areas in U.P. have suffered considerably. It is amazing that the Minister of Steel, Mines and Fuel while replying to question this morning was trying to shield the Railway Minister. He was saying that the difficulty in lifting coal was not entirely due to paucity of wagons. It was due to some other reasons. But he went on to say that the local authorities had to resort to road transport to move coal from those mines. If that is so, I do not know why, if the wagons had been made available in the past and if they are made available today, there was necessity to move coal from the colliery by road transport. Road transport is costlier and ultimately it is not economic. So, we can very well say that there is a sort of friction or lack of co-ordination between the two wings. It has also been borne out clearly that transport of goods or ores has suffered because there has been wagon shortage. If there has been no shortage, at least there has been considerable delay in getting them.",
227: "Mr. Deputy Chairman, Sir, the Railways are very important from the point of view of those who believe in the ever-increasing part that the public sector should play in the life of the country. The Railway Minister, to the efficiency of whose administration I wish to pay a tribute, says that the Railways have a dual role to play. Well, Mr Deputy Chairman, I would say that greater importance should be placed on their character as a public utility service. I do not say that no importance should be placed on their commercial utility side, but greater importance should be placed on their public utility service. The Railways, therefore, should be model employers in this country. They should set the pattern for employers in this country, and that is the pattern that should be followed by the private sector also. Now, Sir, even private companies can run commercial concerns but it is the belief of socialists that the State alone can run them in a manner consistent with public welfare. Therefore, the supreme criterion by which the Railway administration should be judged is the utility so far as the public is concerned. Therefore, I think the Railways should be responsive to public needs. They should have the public welfare at heart. I am glad to find that non-official agencies are being associated with the Railways in a number of ways. There are a number of committees that have been enumerated by the respected Railway Minister. They provide the Railway administration with non-official help and cooperation. I say, Sir, that if nationalised industries are to make an appeal to the country, their public utility work must become increasingly clear to the public. Whether from the public point of view the Railways contribute more or less to the General Revenues, should be a matter of less concern than their efficient running. Now, Sir, I listened with interest to the speech of my friend, in which he catalogued the grievances of Railwaymen and suggested various methods in which the administration can be more responsive to the needs of Railwaymen. I fully agree and support those recommendations. Then, Sir, it is a matter of great concern that House rents in some places are very high, and the Railway employees are given House rents at low rates. Also, I think there is need for an increase in the Railway checking staff. If the Railway checking staff is increased, ticketless travel will go down provided that you make it worthwhile for the Railway staff to carry out their duties. I say that some reward should be given to those members of the checking staff who successfully launch prosecutions against ticketless travellers. I think, Sir, if they have a prospect held out to them that in case they are able to catch ticketless travellers, they will be given some reward, they will be more active. Then, Sir, there is no room for self-complacency so far as our second class travelling facilities are concerned. I gratefully recognise that the Railway Minister is doing his best but I think that this can be improved and should be improved. There should be more Janta trains for second class passengers. I find, Sir, that there is going to be a provision for more fans for first class passengers. Well, I do not grudge that facility to the first class passengers, but I would like more facilities to be given to our second class passengers because it is they who contribute most to their revenues. It is heart-rending to see our overcrowded trains and we anticipate that there will be an increase in our railway traffic. As a matter of fact, I think that when our women get fully emancipated, they will be travelling much more in our Railways than they are doing today. You go and see Western countries. There, you find that the greater number of passengers are represented by women. It is not so in this country. I would say one or two words about catering in our Railways. I am not one of those who wish to be very critical of catering. I think the standard of catering is not bad. On the whole, it is fairly reasonable but the number of waiters in our platforms required to be greatly increased. I myself had ordered dinner at Delhi station and had gone without food. It is because the waiter is not able to bring food in time. This has happened several times. This needs to be looked into. At one time, we used to have a number of waiters running all over a station. That is not so now. The number has gone down. If the air-conditioned travellers and the first class passengers find it difficult to get food, much worse must be the case with the second class passengers. A complaint which I have often heard from many second class passengers and many people of moderate income is that the charge per kg. of luggage is too high.",
228: "Mr. Deputy Chairman, I read the speech of the hon’ble Railway Minister with very great interest and I fully associate myself with the sentiments expressed by Dr. Kunzru that the speech makes us very happy. The Railways, being our premier national undertaking, have had to shoulder many onerous and heavy responsibilities during the last 60 years of planning and development and it must be said to the credit of the Railways that they have acquitted themselves very creditably. The hon’ble Railway Minister had referred to many things in his speech and the credit goes to the Railway Administration for such achievements. I need not to narrate those achievements here because they have been referred to by many hon’ble Members of this House and they are found in the Railway Minister’s speech also. Those of us here who have been lucky to visit the various installations and workshops as members of the Public Accounts Committee or the other Committees can bear witness to the great progress that is being made all round towards saving foreign exchange and making the Railway Ministry a model for other Ministries to emulate. His speech is a frank assessment of achievements and omissions and the hon’ble Railway Minister deserves to be congratulated for not having hidden the drawbacks that have come to his notice. Apart from the achievements, there are many things which have been pointed out by some hon’ble Members of the opposition on this side which, according to them, leave much to be desired and have to be coped with. The hon’ble Minister himself has stated in his speech that much leeway has to be made. He himself has said that the evil of ticketless travel has not shown any appreciable decline. This is a very big Department with its ramifications far and wide and it is beyond human control that such evils can be minimised outright. But I hope that efforts will be continued to be made to keep the evil of ticketless travel under check which, of course, is a very difficult task. Similarly, the administration admits that the loss of Railway property is causing serious concern. With these general remarks, I would now like to come to some specific points. One of the important points which has been criticised by this House is in regard to the declaration of the Railway Minister that there will be no revision of passenger fares. But two minor adjustments have been made in the Bill. One is that the special surcharge at present levied has been raised slightly and the other is that the minimum distance charged for coal has been altered slightly. With regard to the first item, very small revenue is being expected which is of the order of about Rs. 50 lakhs per annum while in regard to the second item regarding coal even a figure has not been given because it is stated to be a very small item. Beyond this, this year no change has been made in regard to freight rates as well as passenger fares. There have been many comments on this point and some of my friends on this side attributed it to this being probably the Budget speech in the year before the election. I am sure Shri Jagjivan Ram will not put the interest of the party above the country, and he must have had very cogent reasons for not enhancing the fares and freight rates. We will be very pleased indeed to know his point of view as to what he has to say in the matter. But we know very well that already taxes in the country are very heavy all round. This view might be behind the mind of the hon’ble Minister to decide that this year the fares and freight rates should not be raised. But all the same, we will be interested to know his point of view. We do hope that his example will be followed by the hon’ble Finance Minister also when he presents his Budget before long and the country will indeed be very grateful to him as the travelling public is grateful to the hon’ble Railway Minister for his Budget proposals this year. Sir, I come to the question of Railway finances. The Railway Minister himself has made such a nice case in regard to the raising of fares and freight rates. Therefore, it is all the more surprising that, on the other hand, he makes a very strong case for raising the fares and the freight rates and, on the other, he has not taken this step at all. But looked at purely from a financial angle, the finances of the Railways make a little unhappy revelation. These points have been discussed in detail by many of the hon’ble Members of this House and I need not go into them but I will refer to them only in a brief way. We will shortly be entering into the Eleventh Five Year Plan. A large amount will be earmarked for the Railways during the Eleventh Plan.",
229: "Mr. Deputy Chairman, Sir, we are discussing the Budget for the year 2002-03 which is the first year of the Tenth Five Year Plan and therefore it is appropriate that the Finance Minister has given a bird’s-eye view of what has been achieved during the first nine Plans. The Economic Review also gives a comprehensive view of our achievements as well as of certain shortcomings here and there. I would, therefore, congratulate the Finance Minister and his Ministry for placing before us a realistic picture as has emerged during the last fifty years and the approach which the Finance Minister thinks we should adopt towards the Tenth Five Year Plan. This is not an ordinary Budget for one year or for two years. This Budget should be looked at from the point of view of the beginning of our next journey towards the Tenth Five Year Plan. The Finance Minister has been told because there is nothing secret about the Budget in the plan period. The Tenth Plan as it has been presented in the draft form is before the people. There, it has been envisaged that in order to see the Plan through, about Rs. 17,000 crores would have to be raised in the country both at the State and at the Central level. So, the taxes which have been imposed in this year’s Budget were not something which came suddenly. He has, therefore, to make a bold and courageous effort not to play to the gallery but to be realistic and practical, if we have got to see the Tenth Plan also through. I have been saying on the floor of the House that the tax burden has been more or less increasing from year to year. I do not want to repeat what I said last year. But it is clear from the Economic Survey, as well as from his speech, that during the last ten years the tax revenue of the country, both Central and of the States, has increased. Most of it has clearly come out of either excise duties at the Central level or sales tax at the state level. We are also not to forget that when development takes place, industrial centres and population increase, the municipalities and the corporations have to levy various taxes. Their revenue generally comes out of what is called Octroi Duty. Now, somebody has got to foot the Bill of development and this Bill, more or less during the last ten years, has been footed generally by the people. In this context, one has to analyse the situation and find out whether these taxes have come out of nothing or whether these taxes have come out of something more which has been put into the pockets of the people as a result of the development that has taken place in our economy. The Survey says that the national income has gone up by about 40 per cent. The per capita income has gone up by 20 per cent. How that has been distributed among the various sectors of the society is a matter which is under investigation and I hope before long the Committee will be able to place before us statistics regarding the distribution of the national income. There is one thing which comes to my notice and it is this. When we are having a planned economy, it must be based on actual statistics. Our statistical apparatus in this country is really defective. Probably, it is in the course of making. If we point out the defects to the Government and the Planning Commission as we see them they might create a better apparatus, so that from year to year we will know exactly where we stand. As the hon’ble Finance Minister has stated in his speech, production has increased more or less according to our expectations. Industrial production has increased more or less according to our expectations. Industrial production has gone up during the last ten years by about 66 per cent. Agricultural production has gone up by one-third. But if you look at the industrial production from a wider view, it gives a better picture. From the index figures of industrial production that have been supplied, one finds that there are in this country certain established industries like jute, textiles, etc. If the rate of production in new industries like the steel industry, the increase in electricity and certain other things are taken into consideration, we will find that the production has gone up by about 100 per cent. Now, actually this is the achievement as far as the two Plans are concerned. Therefore, in trying to criticize or make comments on this year’s Budget particularly, one has to take stock of the situation as it exists as a whole. Certain trends have been visible. The trends show that, prima facie, during the last ten years certain concentration of wealth has taken place. The Government has recently appointed a Committee which will look into it.",
230: "Sir, as a teacher, I am pleased to note that the Government have appointed an old teacher, Dr. Kothari as the Chairman of the University Grants Commission. We are proud of his scholarship and of his devotion to duty and we feel that under his able guidance, the University Grants Commission would be able to render increasing service to the cause of education in this country. I am glad to know from the Education Minister that the University Grants Commission and the Education Ministry are functioning harmoniously but I wish to point out that in the last report of the University Grants Commission the Commission the pointed out certain difficulties in carrying out its responsibilities. I do not know what steps were taken afterwards to remove those difficulties and to ensure to the University Grants Commission autonomy which is its due. Sir, we are holding conferences of the Ministers of Education and conferences of the Vice-Chancellors of the Universities and I feel that we should also hold conferences of the Chairmen of the University Grants Commissions of various States. In spite of that jurisdiction we are holding conferences of Vice-Chancellors of Universities and we are dealing with various educational questions. If there are no University Grants commissions in certain states and if they are not functioning properly it is the duty of the Education Minister at the Centre to deal with that problem also in the conference of the Ministers of Education of the various States if they find some difficulty in having a conference of the Chairmen of the University Grants Commissions of the various States. I do submit that the universities are not functioning as autonomously as perhaps the Education Minister wished them to function. I know that in the last Report of the University Grants Commission, it was said that freedom is vital to good education and democracy and I know that our Education Minister today also repeated the same idea in other words. But I am afraid that interference in University education is rather increasing. The bureaucratic spirit is tending to dominate the university life much more than it did when we were under the British regime. Universities in certain States are tending to be instruments of the Government’s policies. Intra-party conflicts at Government level and often conflicts between the State Governments and the Union Government in certain cases cause difficulties in the administration. I do know that for the present state of affairs teachers and students are to an extent responsible, but I beg to submit that the higher authorities are, in no way, less responsible for the present state of affairs in our Universities. Without mentioning names, we know that proper care is not taken in the appointment of Vice-Chancellors. If the system of election has failed, selection by Government has proved no better, so far as the cries of the Vice-Chancellors are concerned. In many universities, the Directors of Education are chosen as Vice-Chancellors and I have reason to believe that their selection is in general resented by the professors of the Universities concerned. I do admit that some of the Directors of Education might be fit even to be in charge of universities, but I do feel that if the Government wish that persons in charge of secondary education should also take interest in university education, it is proper to appoint them as university professors before they are appointed as Vice-Chancellors of Universities. I have in mind a person like Dr. Amarnath Jha, who belonged to the Provincial Education Service. He served as a University professor, had experience of University education, and then when he became the Vice-Chancellor of the University, he discharged his duties as Vice-Chancellor, admirably well. I wish to point out that personal character, wide human sympathy, interest and understanding of university education, capacity for leadership, faith in the democratic ideals, reputation for learning, and confidence of the authorities are absolutely necessary in a good Vice-Chancellor and proper care should be taken in devising ways and means for selecting proper persons as Vice-Chancellors of Universities. I welcome the new pay scales of teachers of the Central Universities. I do wish to point out that there is a great need for the amalgamation of the grades of lecturers and Readers. Most of the teacher conflicts are due to these two grades of lecturers and Readers, and greater harmony will prevail among teachers in case the two grades, subject to certain efficiency bar, are amalgamated. I do feel that there is no marked difference in the abilities of teachers of Central and State Universities and there is need for equalisation of the pay of teachers of State Universities. Whoever may be responsible for the difference in pay, the country would suffer if there is no equalisation of pay, because disaffection would continue and this will tend to spoil the university life and standards. I wish to point out that some system of transfers should be encouraged by the University Grants Commission.",
231: "Mr. Deputy Chairman, Sir, I welcome the Bill which has been moved by the hon’ble Minister. This is a Bill which has got the consent of the important organisations of the Scheduled Castes and of the Scheduled Tribes and as such it is in the fitness of things that we should try to respond to the desire of those organisations and their representatives. Sir, the sentiment of those organisations is quite understandable because in the arrangement, as it exists at present, those members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes who want to take advantage of the reservation made for them in the Constitution in order to represent certain constituencies in the legislatures, are labouring under a distinct disadvantage. The disadvantage is that a double-member constituency, by its very nature is an unwieldy constituency and except in certain urban areas, the constituency covers a very wide area, and it becomes very difficult for any member to approach each and every voter, as he should, to convey his ideas, his policies and his programmes, and to canvass his vote. Sir, it is a well-known fact that the larger the constituency, the greater the expenditure for any candidate who wants to get the votes of the electorate in that constituency. The members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes are not so prosperous or have not got enough resources to manage such large constituencies, and, therefore, what happens in the ultimate analysis is that this member of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes has to enlist the cooperation of the candidate who stands for the general seat, and even the newspapers normally describe the candidate from the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes as rather a running mate of the candidate who is fighting for the general seat. It is a very undesirable thing because thereby, the special protection, which the Constitution has given and which this Parliament has extended, would not be available to the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and they will have to enlist the support of the general constituency candidates. It is perhaps because of that and because of the lack of resources and because of unwieldiness, the constituency should be bifurcated. Again, Sir, there is a provision that after the delimitations, a chance will be given to the various parties concerned to make any representation. Sir, this Bill is a very welcome measure. At the same time, one cannot overlook the fact that, when these constituencies are bifurcated, especially because of the provision in sub-clause 3(b), it requires that the Commission should reserve the single-member constituency in a manner in which they would be greater concentration of population of the Scheduled Castes or, as the case may be, of the Scheduled Tribes in the constituency which is reserved for them. That being the case, a certain amount of separate constituency principle does not incorporate as a result of the bifurcation. One has, therefore, to be cautious that once this bifurcation takes place, it does not go further in the direction of separate constituencies and ultimately does not result in separate representation, as was existing during the British days. It is very difficult, Sir, to give any suggestions regarding the precautions that might be taken. Ultimately, the only solution of this complex problem is to raise the status of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes so that their separate identity may completely disappear and they may become part and parcel of the Indian community as such. Till we reach that stage where in they become an hon’ble section of our community, enjoying the same status as other sections of the community not only in law but also in fact, this type of protection will become necessary, certain risks will have to be taken with regard to the separation and reservation of constituencies for these weaker sections of our community. Therefore, while the risks are there, this particular Bill is in response to the wishes of the people concerned and, therefore, has to be welcomed. Sir, one word more regarding the amendment of my friend and I have done. That amendment seeks that before the delimitation takes place, a committee should be appointed to advise the Election Commission on the manner in which this delimitation should take place. I am afraid, Sir, I am not in agreement with the suggestion made therein. Ultimately, we have to trust the Election Commission as an impartial body. They will be guided by the instructions that have already been given in this Bill and will do its best to act according to these instructions. If we do not trust the Election Commission, democracy in this country will not be able to flourish at all. Therefore, it is desirable that the question of delimitation should be left to this impartial and autonomous Commission, the Election Commission, which is in charge of election matters at the Centre and in the States.",
232: "Mr. Vice-Chairman, Sir, thank you very much for having given me this opportunity even on the first day to speak on this Child Labour Bill. Sir, I support the Bill. The Bill seeks to give more benefits to the child labour which is being employed in our country. Sir, I would like to submit that in our country even a hundred years ago when Britishers were ruling us in 1881 when Lord Ripon was ruling our country, a Bill was introduced. In that, children below the age of seven years were not allowed to work. But in 1934, there was an amendment brought. The hours of work were considered as five hours for the child labour. They brought several other legislations the Factories Act, the Plantation Labour Act and so many other Acts for the purpose of protecting the interests of the child labour. Sir, there are about 16 million child labourers in our country. Of them, 10 million are employed in the urban sector and 6 million in the rural sector. Even, in that, the agriculture sector alone is absorbing more than 78 per cent of the child labour in our country. If we see the commerce and industry sector, the child labour employed there is more, compared to what it was ten years back, in spite of the welfare measures taken by the Government. In spite of our saying that the child labour should be minimised, we find there is a spurt in their employment. The child labour could not be contained because of the socio-economic conditions. I would like to submit the very salient points which have been given in the Bill itself by the hon’ble Minister. When the hon’ble Minister became the Labour Minister here, he went to the State of Tamil Nadu, especially to Sivakasi, and saw that more than 50,000 children are being employed with wretched conditions. There were no safety measures for them. Health hazards were there and the children were not given vocational training. Proper attention was also not given to them. This Bill seeks to prohibit the child labour in particular hazardous industries and regulates the employment of children in other industries. A Schedule has been given for the purpose of giving employment to the children with lighter conditions. The children who are employed in such conditions should be given protection. I would like to submit further that the children who are being employed are coming for work because of abject poverty. We cannot all of a sudden eliminate the child labour for the simple reason that about 40 per cent of the total population is living below the poverty line. Therefore, the children who are coming from the rural areas and also from the urban sector are actually helping the family, though they do not go in for education. In such a condition I would like to tell the hon’ble Minister that in the organised sector this legislation will work well, but if you go to the unorganised sector like the construction industry and also the agriculture sector, this will not work. I would like to suggest to the hon’ble Minister that he should see that this Act is to be enforced with full strength because the child labour is exploited by the employers for the simple reason that they can be paid low wages and made to work for 14 to 16 hours for according to their whims and fancies. Now, they have to give minimum wages as is required under the Act. Then, I would like to stress upon the point that the children’s health is not given due consideration. If we go to the restaurants, tea stalls or factories, we see their wretched conditions. In other areas, we find that the children are not given the benefit which an employee is being given. That being so, bringing in this legislation would help improve the working conditions of the children who are helping their families by working in factories, plantations and in agriculture. Sir, the Bill gives ample opportunity to the children who are employed in the agriculture sector, especially for the purpose of getting more wages, because wages as defined under the Minimum Wages Act will apply in this case also. On the whole, we find this Bill as a social legislation which actually gives benefit to the children who have been exploited by the employers in various fields. The last point I would like to make is with regard to safety measures and health conditions. The hon’ble Minister has given these items under the general category as has been given in the Factories Act and said that the same measures would apply here also. But I would like to suggest that the Child Labour Bill, 2006 should have a separate clause dealing with safety measures and health conditions which can be enforced effectively by the authorities concerned. I hope our hon’ble Minister would consider this proposal for effective implementation of this Bill.",
233: "Sir, when one sees the estimates of the Railways, one feels that estimates are too much in regard to the foreign exchange component. I should congratulate the Railway Ministry for having spent less than the estimated amounts. But, Sir, efficiency does not mean more expenditure. You may spend less and still you may feel very happy about it. Efficiency does not mean only a measurement in terms of money. Delays, inefficient administration, late running of trains, losses, delay in moving the passenger and goods traffic, all these contribute to a setback to national development as well as efficiency. Sir, so much has been said about coal and about the failure of the Railways to transport coal. Coming from a place with the largest production of rice, I can say with great emphasis that in Andhra, for want of wagons, rice could not be transported to the South and to other places, especially Kerala. Not only rice, but with regard to articles like jaggery, charcoal, timber, firewood and other things, there was a heavy blockade in Andhra as far as the Railways were concerned. Sir, while talking about coal, many hon’ble Members referred to Bihar and West Bengal. But I would like to mention a word about the coal mines of the South. For want of wagons about 700,000 tonnes of coal continued to lie at the pitheads and all this could not be moved to the South where there was a great demand for coal. The coal production in the collieries was according to the Plan. It was not as if the Railways did not expect or that the colliery produced something more than the expected allotment. But the Railways fell short of it. In this connection, Sir, I would like to point out that when there was an uproar in Parliament in February over the shortage of wagons on the South-Eastern Railway, instead of trying to solve the problem in a more practical and in a good way, immediately the Railway Minister said that he had switched off 150 wagons serving the colliery belonging to the Central Railway to the South-Eastern Railway. If you want to solve a problem, it is not by creating another problem. The hon’ble Deputy Minister seems to be very doubtful, but I can tell him that 150 wagons were removed from the Central Railway. Yesterday, the Railway Minister, while answering one of the questions regarding the movement of coal, said that it was not always the Railways’ fault. I do agree that it is not always the Railways’ fault. The whole difficulty is that there is not co-ordination between his Ministry and the other Ministries. He also suggested that they would like to divert some of the coal to road and waterways. I do welcome that suggestion. From today’s papers, I find that the World Bank, the Planning Commission and the Railway Ministry had a meeting with shipping companies who are willing to supply 24 more ships to transport a million odd tonnes of coal to the South. In this connection, I would suggest that transport by water costs Rs. 37 more per tonne. Secondly, the coal supplied through ships is not graded properly, in the sense that it gets mixed up. When they supply it to industries, the latter do not get the proper quality and what they get is not up to the mark. These things should be taken care of while diverting more and more coal towards the South through waterways. Sir, I have to say another thing. In the Neogy Committee, it was suggested that the Railways should consider the question of their contribution to the General Revenues. I do not say that the contribution from the Railways to the General Revenues is not good. It is quite welcome, but what I would suggest is that the Railways can ill afford this much. Now, that they have increased their dividend, they are not in a position to divert to that extent to the General Revenues. If they have increased their dividend, it does not mean that the Railways are prosperous. But what I feel is that the Railways would do well to think twice about paying more because they have got any amount of work to be done in their own Department. The dividend was increased on the understanding that there would be no change in the rates of freights. But the Railways are not in a position to increase their freight rates because they have to face severe competition from other means of transport. Moreover, an increase in the contribution to the General Revenues may affect national development. Therefore, I suggest that they should reconsider the decision about their contribution to the General Revenues. Sir, the Railways are a curious combination of commercial concern and a public utility organ. On the one side, they have to spend more and more on the comforts of the nation and, on the other, contribute more and more to the national development.",
234: "Mr. Deputy Chairman, Sir, the Bill before the House is for the abolition of two-member constituencies and for setting up single-member constituencies. In other words, the present double-member constituencies are proposed to be bifurcated as single-member constituencies with reservation of seats or constituencies for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Now, Sir, a very crucial moment in the history of our young democracy has come. Wherefrom has this reservation arisen? Is not reservation repugnant to the very principle of democracy? Still, we have reconciled ourselves to this reservation. A reservation might be in any form, it might be in the form of constituencies, it might be for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. It is a fact of history that in our society there are people who are called weaker sections and they go by the name of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. I do not know whose fault it is but anyway in our society, we find a section of people who are said to be weak. Certainly, they are weak. Their cases deserve to be considered and should be given topmost priority but there is a lot of misapprehension when we talk of reservation of seats. Is a single member of the Harijan community or Scheduled Castes going to solve the problem of the entire Harijan population? Self-reliance, self-respect and things like that are talked of. How do they come? Will they come only by making a single man a member of the Assembly or Parliament? Will that give self-respect to the entire community? On the other hand, I would believe that self-respect, self-reliance or self-confidence, whatever you call it, can come more by education, more by economic upliftment, more by spread of culture, more by mingling with other classes of people and these are the measures that are called for at present in order to uplift the weaker sections of the people. Anyway, they are there. Millions of rupees are spent on the uplift of these people and I am sure, never before in the history of this country such a lot of good to these people was done as is being within these 50 or 60 years of our independence. I am sure, all these differences would disappear and India will emerge as a cohesive nation but in the meanwhile, something has to be done. Then, it was thought that it was the best arrangement that could be thought of and it was then thought that at the end of 10 years, this reservation would be done away with and there would be only full-fledged democracy functioning. Now at the end of 10 years, we have come to the conclusion that instead of these double-member constituencies, we shall have to set up single-member constituencies with reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. I should think that it is a great retrograde step that we have taken. It is not an advance that we are making in our democratic set-up. I am sure that this has happened on account of the pressure of certain sections of the people who day and night harp on self-reliance, self-respect, etc. Now, let us consider if this system that is being thought of by this Bill is going to create any vested interests. Let us also consider if a spirit of segregation will be created by the step that we have taken. These are the negative aspects of the step that we are now proposing. If vested interests are going to be created, if a spirit of separatism is going to be created in this country, if perpetuation of segregation is to take place, let us reject this Bill here and now. We have paid very heavy cost in the name of reservation of seats. Our country was divided. Had it not been for this principle that was introduced, however unwittingly, our country would not have been divided today. Having found that position, let us be careful of what we do now. Now who, in this world, will give up an advantage gained, whether rightfully or wrongfully gained? We have seen it in the nature of man not to give up a right that he has earned. On the other hand, he wants to perpetuate it. Then as the lady Member said, who knows what will happen after 10 years? Of course now, there are big prophecies that after the end of 10 years they are going to do away with the single-member constituencies with reservation of seats but who knows what will happen? Will the same Scheduled Caste brethren not insist on their rights to have a separate vote and a separate constituency? What guarantee is there? Why do you introduce this malaise into our system? So, I would utter a very respectful, mild warning here that what we do today might do a great mischief tomorrow. What matters most is our attitude to the weaker sections of the community.",
235: "When the House rose last evening I was in the midst of an argument concerning the propriety of exempting Government companies from the provisions of Company law. I wish to make it clear that where Government owns 100 per cent of the shares in a company, obviously many of the rules applicable to ordinary companies cannot be applied. Indeed, the well-known authority on modern company law, summarised the position thus: It will be appreciated that the absence of shares and shareholders automatically renders large and important branches of company law totally inapplicable, rules relating to the raising and maintenance of share capital, the control of directors by members, protection of minority shareholders, company meetings and the like can have no relevance. As we have said earlier, the knotty problem of the relationship between the management and the members is solved by the abolition of the latter. But the approach of our Joint Committee to this problem is difficult to appreciate. Government companies are put in a peculiarly privileged position. Last night, I happened to peruse the minutes of the Fourteenth Meeting of the Joint Committee which considered this question. The recommendations submitted by the Finance Ministry miss the point. There have been exemptions suggested for certain types of companies, but I do not think that any purpose will be served by having any of the Government companies other than those in which Government has 100 per cent shares brought within the purview of the exemption clause at all. We have to bear in mind that a Government company, in which 51 per cent of the shares are held by the Government, is not a company which is the exclusive property of the Government. It is one in which the Government has a technical majority holding of the shares and, in theory, the Government, according to the provisions of the Bill, is given powers to revoke all the safeguards provided in the Companies Bill. Let me read out briefly the particular section which covers these exemptions. I want to ask only a few questions of those who have taken a prominent part in the deliberations of the Joint Committee. What is it that you seek to achieve by granting such an exemption? The Government can, if it deems necessary, cheerfully decide one fine morning to exceed the overall limit of managerial remuneration laid down in clause 190. Of course, such a dispensation will be said to be in the national interest and we would then have to reconcile ourselves to this change. Under clause 234, Government has to entertain complaints from shareholders. But exemption from this provision can be made. Government companies after all are run by people of virtue. How can we ever entertain any complaint against Government directors? Indeed, the blanket power that has been given confers on the executive full and complete authority to dispense with any or all the provisions of the Companies Act, except two provisions to which specific reference is made. Of course, the argument would be put forward that Government would not be unreasonable, that it will not exercise these powers. I fail to understand the validity of this argument. If you do not choose to exercise these powers, then why should Parliament give these powers to people who might not use them at some future date? After all, a statute is in existence until it is amended, and at any moment changes can occur. Some day, a rash Finance Minister might come to this House and dispense with all these elaborate safeguards which are meant to protect the interests of shareholders. I think it is morally unjust and constitutionally improper to confer these blanket powers on Government. Have the legal consequences of such powers being given been examined? I have grave doubts whether this particular provision is in conformity with Article 14 of our Constitution. We have after all a written Constitution which assures equal protection under law. On what grounds of legality can we distinguish between shareholders in a Government company and shareholders in a private company? I believe the courts would have something to say on this classification of categories which has been attempted by the Joint Committee. How can we strip them of their rights? The shareholders have already been stripped of their virtues by the Government which does not trust them and now we are called upon to deprive them of their rights in Government companies. Even in a corporation State Corporation although it is true that shareholders have limited rights, where an infringement of the statutory powers by the corporation occurs or where there is an infringement of their rights, the aggrieved individuals have a right to go to courts of law. Under this peculiar provision, if it is held to be valid, it will mean that the Government, if it so wants can deprive shareholders of all their rights. It is in the fitness of things that the shareholders should be given a fair deal in future.",
236: "Mr. Speaker, I have already submitted in my speeches on the general discussion that the grievances of the staff are mounting and there is growing discontent. I have to add that the staff are not well treated. The concessions which were enjoyed by them during the last 5 years are being withdrawn by the Railway Administration one after the other. I can quote certain instances. With regard to pass facilities, I can say that the quantum of passes already issued are now reduced. For instance, persons who were drawing Rs. 8000, on or before 3rd May, 2008 are considered to have qualified for second class passes whereas those who are getting that pay after that day are disqualified for second class passes. With regard to the Privilege Ticket orders, there is curtailment. Another factor is the retired railway employees were getting passes and that is now being reduced to the minimum. Only those who have put in 30 years’ service are given one set of passes in 5 years with regard to class 4 staff. So also with regard to class 3, the concessions they were previously enjoying are being curtailed with regard to the workshop or loco-shed men who were, entitled to take half a day off previously, that right has now been deprived and the Railway Board have said that even if these men take half a day’s leave, will be treated as equal to one day’s leave. This is also a curtailment of their rights. With regard to gratuity, there is a new innovation made now. Even if a railway servant retires after putting in 30 years of service, his gratuity may be proportionately reduced according to the whims and fancies of the administration by seeing his service record. This is a very wrong thing, it is a new attack on the railwaymen. The railwaymen enjoyed medical facilities not only for themselves but also for their wives and children, and even their dependants got the facilities. Now, the right of medical treatment in respect of the dependants is denied, and I do not know the reason for it. I do not understand the difference between matriculation and non-matriculation qualification in the case of the running staff. They do the same work, but why should there be a difference in the pay? A driver who has passed matriculation gets Rs. 200 more. Last year, when I raised this question, the Railway Minister said that knowledge of Hindi or other vernacular is to be encouraged. In spite of that assurance, the matriculation qualification is still insisted upon, for which there is no justification given. With regard to the Payment of Wages Act, the Railway Board refuses to accept certain sections of the Act. Whenever a Railway servant is suspended, on reinstatement he is given full pay for the period of suspension. In fact, that was the judgment of the Bombay High Court, any curtailment of full pay during the period of suspension is ultra vires and in against the Payment of Wages Act. There is a specific case in which this judgment has been given, and in spite of that, the Railway Board refuses to give full pay for the period of suspension. I have brought many such cases to the notice of the Railway Board. Not only that, but I can also quote an instance with regard to the curtailment of annual increments. For imposing punishment, annual increments are cut and this is quite in violation of the Payment of Wages Act. The Railway Board must also consider this point. A third violation is reduction to a lower scale. I can quote the instance of an instructor who was reduced to the station master’s category. He was getting a basic pay of Rs. 10,000 and as a punishment it has been reduced to Rs. 7,000. I may, in this connection bring to his notice the case of one Mr. M. Thomas, an instructor in the Transportation School, whose pay was reduced from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 700 as a punishment. The rule which is quoted is an old rule which obtained in 1941 before the Railways were taken over from the company and before the new rules came into force. Such reductions of salaries are also a violation of the express provisions of the Payment of Wages Act. Apart from this, there are several instances of withdrawal of concessions and major curtailment of the rights of the railway staff. Previously, the loco-sheds were governed by the Factories Act. If the staff work after five O’ clock in the evening when routine working hours are over, they are entitled to an over-time allowance, and the staff in these sheds were getting this allowance. Now, very cleverly the loco-sheds have been removed from the operation of the Factories Act. This real grievance of the staff was brought to the notice of the Railway Minister during the course of the debate.",
237: "The very informative and very useful debate that we have had on the Motion has, I am sure, given the Government a great deal of food for thought. Many suggestions have been made which I have been thankful to find are very largely in accordance with the Government's own ideas on the problems which devaluation has thrown up, and I have no doubt in my mind that, when we set up a suitable machinery for bringing about increased possibilities of consultation between the Government and Parliament in these matters, we should be able to push things forward to a satisfactory stage. I am glad that my hon'ble colleagues, the Ministers of Food and Supply, and Commerce and Industry have been able to participate in this debate, because most of those issues which have been raised in the course of the debate are issues which are concerned with the Ministries which they represent and they are naturally able to speak with fuller knowledge about them. I wish in the little time that I have at my disposal this evening to confine myself to certain broad considerations which hon'ble Members have raised in the course of the discussion. I am fully in agreement with the suggestion made by various speakers that what we need today at the stage that we have reached is not so much more proposals as more willingness, ability and readiness to implement proposals. The question of implementation is really the most vital question that we have to face today. The more I think of the economic problems with which the country is faced today, the more I feel that at bottom they are not really economic problems in the sense of technical economics, but they are really problems of administration. You look at any of these problems which are causing us worry and anxiety in these days, you will find that deep down they resolve themselves into problems of efficient and honest administration. Now, the question of administration is bound very closely with the other idea which has been suggested by several hon'ble speakers, namely, the idea of co-ordination. When hon'ble Members speak of co-ordination, they are thinking apparently only of Government at the highest level that we here represent. I beg to suggest to the House that from the point of view of co-ordination, what is more important is co-operation at a much lower level than what we represent. As far as the Centre is concerned, there has been a suggestion made from various quarters of the House that what we seem to be suffering from, as far as the Central Government is concerned, is lack of co-ordination between the various Ministries. For some months now, we have been working with an Economic Committee of the Cabinet in which all the Ministers who are concerned with the economic side of administration meet often, sometimes twice a week, to consider jointly the economic problems that affect them all. And since I am, perhaps, very directly concerned with the working of that Committee, I think I have some right to say that we have made a certain measurable degree of progress in the matter of co-ordination at the Centre. But as my hon'ble friend, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, mentioned, the question of co-ordination is equally important as between the Centre and the States. Some of our greatest difficulties arise from the fact that under the kind of Constitutional system under which we are working today, policy is laid down by the Centre, but the execution of the policy is in the hands of State Governments. If there is not enough co-ordination, if there is not sufficient attempt on the part of the two agencies of Government to get together and work out their problems jointly, we shall not be able to make the progress that we all desire. I do hope in the days which are immediately ahead of us, as soon as the Constitution has come into force, we probably shall have at our disposal a more effective machinery for this purpose. Sir, in the speech which I made on the Motion before the House I placed before hon'ble Members the programme that the Government have in mind in order to meet the difficulties created by devaluation. If I may take the most important of the difficulties that we have to face, the most important directions in which Government have to move, I would mention three particularly. Now, I come to the main Bill. It goes without saying that a change is needed in the patents law because our last Act is of 1911. 1911 is a period when this country was industrially not at all developed. It is very necessary to see how our law should be modified in order that the patents law is not detrimental to consumer interest and is not prejudicial to the industrial development of the country. If the law stands against these two, then it has to be changed. Therefore, an attempt has been made to change the law.",
238: "The third point I think that we have got to keep in mind, to which my hon'ble friend, Dr. Shyama Prasad, has referred, is the question of increasing the productive capacity of the country. That, of course, goes to the root of all the problems with which we are faced, and in the circumstances in which we are placed, I have no doubt that all the agencies of Government concerned with production would do their best to meet this difficult situation. Suggestions have been made by hon'ble Members to the effect that there should be a suitable machinery which would enable Government to take into confidence representative elements of the House so that the proposals which Government have in hand might be formulated and might be implemented with their assistance. Government have decided to appoint a committee, an Ad hoc committee, for the purpose of considering what measures should be taken to meet the problems created by devaluation and also to determine whether adequate progress is being made in the matter of implementing these proposals from time to time. Government have accepted the proposals made by hon'ble Members to that effect and I hope, with the approval of the Deputy Prime Minister, to make a very early announcement of the composition and terms of reference of the Committee. There are just one or two other matters that I want to refer to. There has been a great deal of reference during the debate to the question of our relation to sterling. Although hon'ble Members like Professor Ranga were prepared to admit that formally now there is no such thing as a link between the rupee and the sterling, circumstances are such that there appears to be a link, which we are not able to get away from, and I have no doubt that what he has at the back of his mind is that since all this trouble arises from the fact that the greater part of our trade is with the sterling area, it is necessary that we should reorganise our trade in such a manner that the sterling area will not dominate our foreign trade to the extent that it does now. The difficulty about that is this. As Pandit Thakurdas Bhargava said in his speech yesterday, you cannot get away overnight from the commitments which history has made for us during the last many years. It is a very difficult thing to build up trade connections, but it is a quite easy thing to destroy them. Rightly or wrongly, for purely accidental reasons or by historical developments, it so happens today that most of our trade connections are with the countries in the sterling area, and I think it would be a mistake from the point of view of our own interests to do anything which will destroy these long standing trade connections which are of very great help to us. What we might do in order to achieve the kind of objective that hon'ble Members have in mind, is not to reduce or to destroy the trade connections which we have in the sterling area, but to build up new connections in other areas, so that the existing trade connections that we have in the sterling area would not be so large a proportion of our total foreign trade. That is really the direction in which we ought to move. There is one other point I want to raise. That is a point which Mr. Munshi mentioned that the circumstance which seems to stand in the way of increasing production in the country, of helping progress on saving and investment is the way in which the Income Tax administration of the country is doing its job. I have been in very close touch with the subject because of representations I have had from various quarters and my own feeling is that the officers of our Income Tax Department, engaged as they are in an extremely thankless job, are trying to do their best in order to bring about a better tradition in this matter. I have for some time felt that one of the difficulties of our Income-tax administration is that we have not yet been able to establish anything like a satisfactory liaison between the Income-tax administration and the public with whom that administration deals. In other countries, I think there has been a great deal of development by research in the matter of cultivating satisfactory relations between those who collect income-tax and those who pay it. It is one of my objects at present in regard to the question of income-tax that we should have some kind of organisation which will give our officers in the Income-Tax Department the right attitude with regard to the question of dealing with the public.",
239: "Sir, if I intervene at this stage of the debate, it is not for the purpose of saying much on the factors which led to devaluation because that is a matter which has already been dealt with by the Finance Minister, but I would like to confine my remarks mainly to one aspect of the problem which has been emphasized by more speakers than one, and that is with regard to the effects of devaluation on production in India. It was some comfort to find that in some matters at least, we had support from strange quarters I mean my hon'ble friends, the previous speakers, who very ably justified the large imports of capital goods which have come to this country in the course of the last year. So far as the effect of devaluation on production is concerned, let us remember that it is not devaluation alone but two other important factors that have come to play during the last few months. One is our decision to restrict imports which was announced almost a few days before the announcement of devaluation which had a resultant effect on the prices of commodities in India, especially on those commodities which were being imported in large bulks during the last one year. Secondly, the rise in the cost of production of essential commodities in this country, for which reason unfortunately we have not been able to check the rise in the cost of living. Over and above these, devaluation has come. Now, Sir, the question which has been asked by many speakers is what steps Government proposes to take for the purpose of controlling the rise in prices in India and for the purpose of increasing production for, after all, let us not forget that if we want to import less and export more, we will have to produce more in India. If we want to import less and, at the same time, serve the essential economic needs of the people, we will have to produce more in India. I am not going to take your time in disclosing the large number of schemes which Government has prepared in the course of the last two years, some of which are ready to be implemented. Now, it will be a very serious matter not only for the Government but for the House and the country as well if several schemes have to be postponed. One of my hon'ble friends said in the course of the debate today that many of these schemes are developed in a haphazard manner. I join issue there. We have heard a lot about the need for greater co-ordination. I am aware that there is room for greater co-ordination not only amongst the different Ministries but also between the Centre and the States and, if I may say so, between the Government and the members of this House, and, if I may add a little further, between the Government and the people of this country. In fact, I feel more and more today that there is considerable cleavage between the Government and the people because of lack of information on the part of the people of the steps which Government has taken in the course of the last two years in spite of tremendous odds and difficulties. Here, if I may say in all humility, is a responsibility which Members of this House, particularly those belonging to the great Congress organization, have to take upon themselves. You have to go to the people and have got to inspire them to the needs of the situation, to explain to them what Government has done so that you may get the largest possible response from the people. That gap has come into existence. Let us not throw bouquets at each other and say that Government should do it and you should not. But the fact remains that the gap is there and the question is how that gap can be filled up and people’s enthusiasm can be fully roused. So far as Government’s schemes are concerned, I might very briefly allude to one or two schemes so that the House will be able to realise how their non-implementation may adversely affect the economic conditions of the country. The House is aware that we have entered into a contract with a well-known Swiss firm for the manufacture of machine tools. It is a big scheme which will cost India nearly Rs. 150 to 280 crores. We are importing today about Rs. 80 crores worth of machine tools. The Prime Minister pointed out yesterday, and quite rightly, that this is one of the basic industries which must develop in this country if we are going to progress industrially. How far that scheme will be affected now is more than what I can say because we have to settle the question of priorities and decide which are the schemes with which we will go ahead. The same principle applies with regard to the production of steel. After considerable efforts, we have completed our labours.",
240: "Sir, I rise to move that the situation arising out of devaluation of the rupee in terms of the dollar be taken into consideration. The subject of this Motion is admittedly one of grave importance to the country, and I am aware that as Minister of Finance, there is a special responsibility which rests upon me in this matter. I feel, Mr. Speaker, that the best way in which I can discharge this responsibility to the House and to the country is by placing before the House a true, clear, unvarnished picture of the situation as I see it. First of all, I would like to acquaint the House with the circumstances which led step by step to the situation with which we are now faced. I would like to take the House back to about four months ago when, on account of the severe drain upon the dollar resources of the countries included in the sterling area, there began rumours in Europe, and particularly in America, that it would be impossible for the pound sterling, which stands as the master currency of this area, to maintain any longer its exchange value. These rumours became so strong that it was necessary for the United Kingdom to get into consultation with other countries primarily concerned with the dollar currency, that is, the U.S.A. and Canada, regarding the measures necessary for remedying this situation. The House is aware that sometime last June I was expected to proceed to London to discuss the question of the sterling balance with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. I was due to have started from Delhi somewhere about the 2nd June, the official delegation from the country having gone there a little earlier. Then a message came from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to our Prime Minister that in view of the severe strain upon the resources of the sterling area, the Government of the United Kingdom felt it necessary to summon a conference of the Finance Ministers of the Commonwealth countries to discuss this problem. That conference was scheduled to take place sometime in the first week of July and, in consultation with the Prime Minister, therefore, I decided to postpone my visit to London until early in July. The Commonwealth Ministers' Conference took place about the end of the first week of July in 1949. We sat for three days and we considered the measures which should be taken by the countries included in the sterling area to increase our dollar resources and to reduce our expenditure of dollars. Various resolutions were framed at this conference and the whole idea of the Conference was that the resolutions passed at that Conference were to provide the basis on which the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, so to speak the Managing Agent of the Sterling area, was to hold talks later in the year, sometime in September, with the U.S. Treasury and with the Canadian Government. It is an important point to remember, and I should like to lay some stress on it, that the Commonwealth Ministers' Conference prepared the brief on which the Washington talks were to be based and I want further to draw the attention of the House to the fact that in the whole of that brief prepared by the Commonwealth Ministers' Conference, there was no reference to the subject of devaluation. That subject was not discussed at the Conference. There was not even so much as a reference to the subject at the Conference. Then came the talks in Washington in September. The talks in Washington were between the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, and the Minister of Finance of the Canadian Government. The Commonwealth countries were not represented in this Conference. The understanding was that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer would argue the case for the sterling countries on the short note prepared by the Commonwealth Ministers' Conference. I may say, incidentally, that in view of the great importance of these talks in relation to our finances and the general economy of our country, the Government of India felt it necessary to direct Mr. Chintaman Deshmukh, who is now our representative in matters of external finance in Europe and America, to proceed to Washington, some time before these talks began, so as to be present there in the capacity of an informal observer. From public statements which have been made, I understand that before the British Chancellor of the Exchequer and the British Foreign Minister went to Washington, apparently a decision had been taken to devalue the pound sterling. The next stage to which I want to carry these preliminary observations is that the first information that we received here regarding the decision of the U.K. Government to devalue the pound sterling was contained in a message which was sent by Mr. Attlee to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. We had to see the repercussions of devaluation on the British currency.",
241: "At the instance of the Prime Minister, we had a Cabinet meeting to discuss this whole matter and it was held at about 10 p.m. on Friday, the 16th September, the day on which we got this message. The Prime Minister fixed the meeting for 10 o'clock at night, because Mr. Rama Rao's plane was expected to reach here about 8 o'clock in the evening and it was thought that his presence at the Cabinet meeting would help me and my colleagues in coming to a decision on this very difficult subject. Unfortunately, the plane which brought Mr. Rama Rao was delayed by about eight hours. He did not arrive here till early in the morning on Saturday. In the meantime, we discussed this question at the meeting of the Cabinet on Friday night and having reviewed the subject from all angles, we came to the conclusion that in the circumstances there was no solution possible for the Government of India except to devalue the rupee to the same extent as the pound sterling. I should like to say before I proceed any further that although the British Chancellor of the Exchequer had categorically denied that there was any intention on the part of the U.K. Government to devalue the pound sterling, it occurred to me from such indications as I gathered in London that the possibility of the pound sterling being devalued was not altogether to be dismissed. Therefore, we arranged that our technical advisors in the Government of India here and our technical advisors in the Reserve Bank should at once set about an exhaustive and detailed examination of this whole problem which they did. The result of this examination was that in case the pound sterling was devalued we should devalue the rupee to the same extent. That same advice was given to me by Mr. Chintaman Deshmukh. In that opinion the Governor of the Reserve Bank fully concurred. We held another meeting of the Cabinet on Saturday morning at which the Governor of the Reserve Bank was present and the members of the Cabinet, therefore, had an opportunity, so to speak, of reassessing the position in the light of the account which the Governor of the Reserve Bank brought to us of the whole position. We came to the conclusion that the best course was to devalue the rupee to the same extent. The meeting of the International Monetary Fund at Washington to consider the general revision of the exchange values of the currencies of all the member countries was being held on Saturday, the 17th, the day on which we came to our final decision. But I was informed by Mr. Chintaman Deshmukh that he was able to get the International Monetary Fund to postpone the examination of our case until Sunday so that we might have a little more time to examine the position. At 3 p.m. on Saturday, on the decision arrived at by the Cabinet, I sent a cable to Washington to say that we would propose to the International Monetary Fund that the rupee should be devalued in the manner that we decided on. I wanted at that time to inform our neighbours, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, of our decision to make this proposal to the International Monetary Fund. But I could not very well do it on Saturday because Saturday was a business day, and I thought, in view of the great delicacy and secrecy attaching to this particular matter, that the earliest time when I could send a message safely to our neighbours was Sunday morning. On Sunday morning, therefore, I dispatched two telegrams, one to the Sri Lanka Government and the other to the Pakistan Government, informing them that we were making this proposal to the International Monetary Fund. I would like to make a reference to Sri Lanka in this connection because, my friend, the Finance Minister of Sri Lanka immediately after devaluation was decided on both of his currency and of ours made a statement in this Parliament to the effect that he had not been consulted by the Indian Government. I want to place before the House the facts in this connection. Two days before, we received the message from Mr. Attlee, because of the rumours which started all over the world regarding the possible decision of the U.K. Government. The High Commissioner of Ceylon came to see me on the 14th, that is, as I said, two days before we received this message from Mr. Attlee. And he said, there were all these rumours about devaluation and in view of the close currency relations between Sri Lanka and India, he thought it was necessary that the two countries should act in consultation with each other. I entirely agreed with the view that he put before me and I told him two things. First of all, the matter had not been formally and officially considered by our Cabinet, in view of the conclusions reached in the expert investigations that had been going on for long.",
242: "There is just one word that I want to say with regard to the procedure adopted by the U.K. Government. I do not wish in the least to complain because I am fully aware of the difficulties which confronted the U.K. Government in this matter because one of the matters which I presume ultimately led to this decision of the U.K. Government was that because of these wild rumours floating about the world, there was a vast movement of sterling from the U.K. to other countries and probably events compelled them to act in the way they did. They were faced with a very difficult and a very delicate situation. I make the fullest allowance for that fact. Nevertheless, I feel that if arrangements had been considered in time, it would have been possible for the U.K. Government to take the Commonwealth Ministers more fully into their confidence than they apparently did. I say that for this reason, that in the Commonwealth Ministers' Conference which was convened for the very purpose of discussing the dollar situation, there was no reference whatever to the subject of devaluation and if, as I understood it, the resolution passed by the Commonwealth Ministers' Conference provided the brief for the Washington talks, then the decisions reached at Washington by the representatives of the U.K. Government, in my opinion, exceeded the brief that the Commonwealth Ministers gave the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. I cannot help thinking that in a matter which so vitally affects the whole economy of every country in the sterling area, steps should have been taken to arrange for a secret meeting of the Finance Ministers of the Commonwealth countries before this decision was sprung upon them regarding three matters: the need for devaluation, the extent of devaluation, and the time of devaluation. I am quite aware of this: that any such conference would have intensified the rumours that were already floating about, but if I had been in Sir Stafford Cripps' place, what I would have done would have been something like this. Here was the Washington conference discussing this matter on the brief prepared by the Commonwealth Ministers' Conference. It could have been arranged that a report should be made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Commonwealth Ministers' Conference of the results of the talks which he held on the brief we prepared. But that could have been made the ostensible object of the conference. Incidentally, it would have enabled Sir Stafford Cripps to acquaint us really with the circumstances that led to this final decision. Let me say again that I make this statement because I feel we have been placed in a position which led not merely to inconvenience to ourselves but also inconvenience to our neighbours, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, and I think every effort should have been made to avoid the inconvenience that was caused in that way. Now, I proceed to tell the House what precisely are the reasons which led us to take the decision we did. I want to make it perfectly clear that although I feel logically on the basis of economic facts there was a case for devaluation both of the pound sterling and of the rupee, I should have liked to face this problem and to come to my decision regarding the problem after a good deal of more deliberation than I was allowed time for. I feel that in this matter I have had to act not on conviction born of logic necessarily but, so to speak, by the compulsion of events. I am not happy that I have had to make a decision in those circumstances. Nevertheless, since the pound sterling was devalued, I felt, and my colleagues entirely agreed with me, that there was no other course open to us. I say that for this very good reason. Nearly 75 per cent of the export trade of this country is with the countries in the soft currency areas. Therefore, when sterling was devalued if we did not devalue, the result would have been that our export trade to these countries would not merely have greatly diminished but in course of time in certain important directions might have been wiped out altogether: Lancashire piecegoods competing with our piecegoods in the markets of the sterling area, Sri Lanka tea competing with our tea in the same area, East African groundnuts competing with our groundnuts, South African manganese competing with our manganese, and so on. The position was really serious and we could not afford to take the risk involved in keeping the value of the rupee at a higher rate when it was likely to lead to these extremely grave consequences for the country. It is not merely that our export trade would have suffered, the dwindling of our export trade would straightaway have reacted upon our import trade because the only way in which we can pay for our imports is by earning foreign exchange by our exports to the Western Countries.",
